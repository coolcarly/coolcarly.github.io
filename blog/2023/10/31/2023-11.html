I thought I had a bit of time to relax before they sent it back, and during that time I was planning to write a paper. I was shocked when one of my supervisors sent it back within a fortnight! It was so quick and I was so happy. Last week, I also sent a manuscript around for review, which we were going to discuss at last Thursday&#x27;s meeting (9 Nov 2023). </p><p>Now before I tell you how the meeting went, I need to give you some context on my Thursday meetings. </p><p>Every Thursday for the past 4 years, I have met with my supervisors to discuss my work. There is one particular supervisor who made me feel like crap every week - putting me down and telling me that my work wasn&#x27;t very good. I would often cry and be so deflated for the rest of the week. In hinesight, I should&#x27;ve realised that I wasn&#x27;t being attacked personally... but it&#x27;s difficult to reason like that when my biggest insecurity is my intelligence. Therefore, I stopped sharing a lot of the new and creative things that I was trying in the lab because I didn&#x27;t want to feel bad anymore. That&#x27;s also the reason that I never wrote any manuscripts, because she made me feel so bad about myself that I was convinced my work wasn&#x27;t very good. </p><p>Last Thursday, I had a meeting with all of my supervisors about a manuscript that I wrote. Prior to the meeting, I told myself &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter what happens, or what they think about it, because after I finish my PhD, I am going to find a job away from academia.&quot; I tried so hard to be strong. However, during the meeting, I was put down about my experiments and basically told that it was not very good by that particular supervisor that has always made me feel crap throughout my PhD. </p><p>Afterwards, I went home and cried for the rest of the day. I was panicking that I was totally worthless and had no skills. I was so concerned that I had wasted 4 years of my life with nothing to show for it. On Friday (10 Nov), I had a mid-day nap. During this nap, I dreamed that I was in a meeting with my three supervisors and calmly, they told me that my PhD was crap and that we should consider downgrading to a masters degree. </p><p>Once I woke up from this nightmare, I went into freak-out mode. My mind was constantly thinking &quot;I&#x27;ve just wasted 4 years of my life... 4 years where I could have done anything else, built up other skills or started a career and earned/saved money.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m never going to amount to anything.&quot;</p><p>These thoughts still elude my mind. It&#x27;s probably the reason that I lost my vision yesterday as a result of a migraine. </p><p>However, I just need to remind myself that it will be over soon and I will be so happy with the final product.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/2023/12/15/2023-12"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Newer Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Almost there</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/2023/10/31/2023-10"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Updates</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/life">Life</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/science">Science</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/phd">PhD</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2024 Carly Baker.</div></div></div></footer></div>
