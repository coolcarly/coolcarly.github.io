Do you agree? Well about 5-10% of you will not agree. This is because gluten intolerance is a fairly prevalent allergy. Celiac disease is the name given to a gluten intolerance, which is diagnosed in about 1% of people wordwide. People with this disease experience vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, numbness in the hands and feet among many other symptoms, in response to gluten ingestion. Why does this occur?</p><p>Celiac disease is commonly inherited through the genes. One genetic marker of celiac is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genotype. About 30% of people will express this genotype, however, only 1-3% of people will develop the disease. These two genes present on Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) to produce an immune response when exposed to peptides from Gliadin.</p><p>As I explained in my previous bread post, gluten is composed of gliadin, which is the harmful component to people with celiac. Gliadin is difficult to digest, even in healthy humans, due to the presence of prolamins (a group of plant storage proteins). These proteins are generally hydrophobic (or water-hating), with the central region composed mostly of glutamine and proline amino acids. As a result, gliaden will pass into the intestinal barrier. The presence of gliadin in the small intestine produces an inflammtory response, where cells will release tissue transamidase (tTG), often the reason why we would experience bloating in response to breads. tTg expression is increased in celliac sufferers.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/t-tg-89320866901139e2a22b9e89b7763514.jpg" width="849" height="622" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 1. (a) Crosslinking of glutamine and lysine to form a high molecular weight polymer or (b) deamidation of glutamine to form glutamate which is negatively charged at physiological pH. Both reactions are catalysed by tTG</em>.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Once released from cells, tTG crosslinks a protein with a glutamine residue (in this case, the gliadin) to a protein with a lysine group, via a peptide bond. This cross-linking is an important step that leads to insoluble protein aggregates, which can be cleared from the body. However, it can also convert glutamine to glutamic acid in a process called deamidation. </p><p>Deamidation of gliadin produces negatively charged peptides at physiological pH (7.4-7.6), which then has a high affinity for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. The binding of the glutamic acid to the HLA proteins, results in T-cell stimulation, followed by release of proinflammatory cytokines. This inflammatory response leads to the destruction of the intestinal villi, which are responsible for absorbing nutrients.In addition, people with celliac disease, antibodies are produced in response to the tTG release, further invoking the limitation in gliadin digestion and thus, increasing the prevalence of inflammation. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">â</a></h3><ol><li>Sha, X., et al., The prolamins, from structure, property, to the function in encapsulation and delivery of bioactive compounds.

In ICP-MS, the ions are directly measured. In contract, ICP-OES uses an optical spectrometer to measure the photons emitted as they pass through the plasma. While both methods are extremely fast to use, cheap and straightforward, the ICP-OES has a higher sensitivity to detection. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-icp-work">How does ICP work?<a href="#how-does-icp-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does ICP work?" title="Direct link to How does ICP work?">â</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Schematic of ICP" src="/assets/images/fig1-icp-b973c0fd8a33d264862421400b87c4e1.jpeg" width="1280" height="462" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Figure 2.

Images taken from (Hou and Jones) and (McCurdy and Potter)</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>A schematic of an ICP is displayed in Fig 2. The liquid sample is injected into a spray chamber which is converted to an aerosol via a nebuliser. During this process, only the very fine particles are injected into the inductor. In the inductor, the sample aerosol is further dried and vapourised due to the high temperatures (10000 K) in the sample carrier. In this process, all chemical bonds are broken, allowing for the vapourisation of each individual atom (Fig 2b). The free atoms collide with plasma, allowing them to transition to an excited state. Upon relaxation to ground state, the ions/atoms will emit a photon of characteristic energies, which can be used to determine the elemental origin of the ions. The total number of photons emitted is proportional to the concentration.</p><p>The ionisation plasma is typically argon gas as it is chemically inert and contains a high proportion of cations and electrons with a high electron density. In the set up shown in Fig 2a, radiofrequency (RF) is applied to a coil which produces âseedâ electrons which are accelerated and collide with argon gas to form argon plasma and electrons:</p><p align="center"> Ar(g) â Ar<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-sample-preparation">About sample preparation<a href="#about-sample-preparation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to About sample preparation" title="Direct link to About sample preparation">â</a></h2><p>Solubilised solutions (aqueous or organic) are required to perform ICP analysis. Therefore, samples (&lt;0.2 %&gt;) are typically treated with nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) or HCl, in a process referred to as &quot;acid digestion&quot;.  Sample concentrations of &lt;0.2% are crucial to avoid any matrix effects.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="matrix-effects">Matrix effects<a href="#matrix-effects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Matrix effects" title="Direct link to Matrix effects">â</a></h2><p>Matrix effects are interferences in the analysis due ton signal dift caused by the deposition of solids on the sample apertures or signal suppression caused by salt ions. The typical salt interference is caused by oxide formation, which seems to reduce the ion flow and promotes clogging at the sample cone (the interface that analyses ion extraction). With years of research, matrix effects have typically solved through the use of OES compared to MS. ICP-OES relies on photon emission rather than ion acceleration, which makes it less susceptible to interferences. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advantages-of-icp-compared-to-other-elemental-analyses">Advantages of ICP compared to other elemental analyses<a href="#advantages-of-icp-compared-to-other-elemental-analyses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advantages of ICP compared to other elemental analyses" title="Direct link to Advantages of ICP compared to other elemental analyses">â</a></h2><p>As ICP heats to very high temperatures, samples undergo more efficient vaporisation, atomisation and excitation. This allows for a wider range of elements to be analysed by ICP. In addition, the high temperature means that there is less water vapour present, in turn reducing the concentration of oxygen species and thus a lower level of matrix interferences caused by oxide formation. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">â</a></h2><ol><li>Ammann, A.A., Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS): a versatile tool.

Both Pawel and David agreed that I should not be doing anymore lab work and just focus on writing my thesis! There it is &quot;only focus on writing&quot;. </p><p><em>Productivity:</em> From Friday onwards, I started writing all my results down. I wrote a lot in the span of 4 days and I felt that if I kept writing then I could be finished by the end of the month. </p><p><em>Unproductive:</em> On Wednesday 23 August, I had a really bad day of writing. By 3 pm, I was on the lounge watching a TV show. I did not attempt to recommence writing for the rest of the evening. It really messed me around on Thursday. At this rate, I won&#x27;t finish my PhD in time!</p><p><em>A tip to improve productivity:</em> I was lucky this week in my Thursday meeting. I got a few tips from my supervisors about writing. David commented that the best thing to do when you are not feeling like thinking is to write out the methods chapter. He was right. Writing out my methods chapter is a simple way to get myself in the mood of writing and to continue my writing routine. </p><p><em>More unproductivity:</em> This morning, I went driving around Wollongong to try and get a quote to fix my passenger-side mirror of my car. Grant from Fernhill Smash Repairs told me that he would be in touch later in the afternoon. NOTE: the passenger side-mirror is no longer afixed to the car as I nipped it off on the way home from the beach yesterday. Without a passenger side-mirror, I cannot drive my car. This means that I can&#x27;t drive to North Wollongong beach! I need to paddle in the morning for me to feel fresh for a day of writing! This screwed up my whole day. At 10 am, I gave up on writing and decided to head to Innovation Campus to get some data off the computers. I ran there and remained until 4 pm..... and that is all I did today.</p><p>In the evening, Nick and I walked to <a href="/life/food-and-drink/craft-beer/illawarra/barrel-shephard">The Barrel Shephard</a> for dinner and drinks. I felt aweful, like I didn&#x27;t deserve to be going out after a day of very little work and progress. Note to future self: stop going into the lab, save it for the weekend or afternoons.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/08/08/2023-08">A very stupid thing</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-08-08T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 8, 2023</time> Â· <!-- -->4 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>When I woke up at 5.55 am, it seemed like it was going to be another cracker of a day. I prepared for teaching, went for a run, did some stretching and showered all before 8.30 am. I was more than ready to make huge progress today! </p><p>I arrived at work at 9 am and from the minute I began to do things in the lab, everything went wrong. I couldn&#x27;t get any good data. Around 10 am, I went to get help to fix a cable for my potentiostat (as the wires lost connection to reduce the signal). However, I was unsuccessful in getting help. A colleague/researcher said to meet her at 3 pm to repair the cable; but I couldnt wait this long as I was due to teach at 1.30 til 4.30 pm (Week 3 of Semester 2).. </p><p>By this point it was 11 am - I was feeling really tired and unmotivated. </p><p>My first thought was to go home. I lost motivation when I realised that I would only be home for 1 hour before having to leave again. Instead, I pulled out my soft back warmer from my draw and used it as a pillow. I put my head down on the desk and had an hour nap. </p><p>I woke up less tired than before, but really groggy. I packed my safety glasses and water bottle into my handbag and walked towards my car, then drove to the main campus. Travel between the innovation campus and the main campus is really tedious and it is often difficult to find parking in the middle of the day. </p><p>I was parked and ready to get out of the car at 1 pm. I walked towards Panzinis, a cafe located in front of the UOW library. I go here for coffee because they offer staff discounts and I love discouts! I ordered my coffee and it was made within 5 minutes. It was a rather pleasant experience - too bad that I was not in a good mood. </p><p>The undergraduate chemistry labs are located in building 21 on level 3. I headed here after I was handed my coffee - but I was at least 20 minutes early. When I walked into the lab, it was empty abar one demonstrator - Sue. I chatted for less than a minute before rereading over my emails that said I was only rostered for Week 9. In sheer disbelief, I spent a few minutes researching my emails and was convinced that I showed up for no reason! In embarrassment, I left and drove to North Wollongong beach. &quot;Wow&quot; I thought. &quot;How stupid&quot;. &quot;Why didn&#x27;t I read my emails?&quot; </p><p>I was pretty relieved though, because I didn&#x27;t really want to teach. I don&#x27;t need the extra funds that bad and it&#x27;s not worth taking time away from my writing. Excited that I could fix the potentiostat, I also sent an email to a colleague, indicating my error and that I would be there at 3 pm. </p><p>Just as I was about to get out of my car and go for a dip in the ocean to calm down my anxiety and embarrassment, I received an email from Giel (the subject coordinator) who asked me to come back because I was rostered to work. Can you believe how embarrassed I was after this? It took me 15 minutes to return, park and walk to the labs. I quickly walked into the service room, dodging the lines of students waiting to collect a pH probe for their experiment. I threw on a red lab coat, my safety glasses and grabbed a pen. </p><p>I apologised several times to Giel and I literally felt like slapping my forehead because it was such a stupid thing that happened. The worst thing though, was sending a third email to my colleague telling her that I was wrong and I was meant to teach! </p><p>The labs were very slow and very basic. The students were working on acid-base titrations. In that moment, I thought that it wasn&#x27;t too bad. I actually enjoyed it.  I&#x27;m just glad that I don&#x27;t have to teach all the time. The labs ended at 4.30 pm. I drove straight home and relaxed until dinner time. </p><p>I honestly feel like I wasted the whole day.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/08/04/2023-08">Rewarding myself</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-08-04T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 4, 2023</time> Â· <!-- -->One min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Lately, I have been freaking out with the amount of work still left in my PhD. Today, I had planned to have a writing day but I realised as I opened various thesis chapters, that I have actually written a lot! At 11 am, I decided to head into the lab to try to resynthesise a monomer for my second research chapter. While searching the freezer for my materials, I came across a molecule that I had synthesised previously, but never used. It was a dibromo-compound that was initially synthesised for a grignard reaction. </p><p>For fun, I set up a 1 mL (200 mg) scale <a href="/science/polymer-science/synthesis/darp">direct arylation polymerisation</a>. For the rest of the day, I felt so happy and accomplished. I feel so excited to work this polymer up and characterise it. </p><p>To hear more about this, and see the fun I have with these reactions, visit <a href="/phd/side-projects">side projects</a>. </p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/dhap-461e005e73beee5a4a5377372feae3c5.jpeg" width="60%" class="centered-image img_ev3q"></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/life">Life</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/science">Science</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/phd">PhD</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2024 Carly Baker.</div></div></div></footer></div>
