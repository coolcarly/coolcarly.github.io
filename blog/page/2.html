2024</time> ¬∑ <!-- -->17 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Over the long weekend, Nick and I headed to üìç <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mc1zKcQgysVsQXE17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mudgee, NSW, Australia</a> with a group of Nick&#x27;s friends. We were staying in a cute house in Erudgere (~10 mins from Mudgee centre). It was a large house, with 2 bathrooms (and an ensuite, which was apart of a different bedroom - not ours), which were very modern. The house appeared to be recently renovated. There were 7 bedrooms, each containing double beds. We took the bedroom opposite the kitchen. </p><p>This place had a large backyard with the most incredible spa (we went in every night!!! I cannot resist a large body of water). There was also a fire pit located in the yard (about 25 m from the house). Every night, we sat by the fire. It was pretty great. Over the time that we were here, the temperatures were very cool with a maximum of 14 ¬∞C. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="friday-7-june-2024"><em>Friday 7 June 2024</em><a href="#friday-7-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to friday-7-june-2024" title="Direct link to friday-7-june-2024">‚Äã</a></h4><p>We drove up on Friday afternoon. We were very lucky that our neighbours were happy to mind Chip and we said that we should gift them some wine as a thankyou. We arrived at 8.30 pm, after a 4 hour long trip, with very little traffic (most traffic through the Blue Mountains). On the drive, I was astounded at how many cars were travelling this far west. I thought to myself that surely they are not all going to Mudgee? Once we passed Lithgow, all the traffic mostly subsided and we drove alone on the roads.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="saturday-8-june-2024"><em>Saturday 8 June 2024</em><a href="#saturday-8-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to saturday-8-june-2024" title="Direct link to saturday-8-june-2024">‚Äã</a></h4><p>On the Saturday morning, we headed into town and bought coffee from <em>Althea by Zin.</em> This was a very cute little bakery, which sold artisan bread and other pastry treats. The coffee was pretty good, despite us having to order a double shot, and also considering that it was pretty expensive ($11 for two coffees). </p><p>We returned home by 10 am and at 11 am, Adam (a local wine tour guy) picked us up to take us to and from Robert Steins Vineyard (for $100). We had a 11.30 am wine tasting. The wines were good (not sure how else to comment about them). My favourites were definitely the Dry rose and the 2021 Shiraz. </p><p>Lunch was booked at 12 pm at Pipeclay (the restaurant attached). We sat at a long table booked for 11. Our lunch consisted of a 6 course meal, each meal with a wine pairing, which spanned 3.5 hours! The six courses included: </p><ol><li>Pipeclay Pumphouse Charcuterie: which was basically a cheese/meat board with bread. The bread served was pretty amazing. </li><li>Watercress, shiitake mushrooms, chestnut and poached egg: A green soup which I thought was super tasty! However, the poached eggs were over cooked and very hard, despite the waiter describing that the main feature of the dish was the &quot;soft egg and runny yolk.&quot;</li><li>Beef carpaccio with ginger and lemongrass: It looked amazing, however, for me (the vegetarian), they substituted the meat for sweet potato. It was tasty!</li><li>Chinese Five Spice  duck breast with squash, potato and broccolini. This meal was the highlight. The duck alternative was pumpkin. The dish was exactly the same, only the duck was substituted. I noted the flavours of the spice and the milky mash potato underneath. I especially liked the peppery taste of the pumpkin. I would like to try and recreate this dish at some point.</li><li>Strawberry sorbet as the palate cleanser before dessert, which was: </li><li>Spiced coconut custard tart with banana and green tea ice cream. I can&#x27;t comment too much about it. It was good. Probably as good as a tart can get. </li></ol><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/mudgee1-a34fcc3c709ebb1aa47caaeb42364f21.jpeg" width="1280" height="868" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img Caption: Robert Steins six course meal.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>While the meals were tasty, I left the restaurant after 3.5 hours still feeling hungry. It is not enough to simply substitute the meat for vegetables. It seemed like it wasn&#x27;t really considered, and they only cared for creating a similar flavour. In addition, the service was very slow! I felt like I spent my whole day there, and I did!</p><p>The wine pairings were pretty good as well. However, the waiter forgot our last pairing! It really did undermine their services there and I probably would not recommend this place, nor return, considering that we paid $110 per person + $60-80 for the wine pairing. Furthermore, it seemed like the staff constantly forgot about us, with people who arrived hours after us, leaving before us!! </p><p>Just before we got our coffees, the bus driver arrived to pick us up. We ended up taking a takeaway coffee on the bus on the drive back to our accomodation, where we enjoyed a fire and BBQ dinner. </p><p><em>Sunday 9 June 2024</em>
We were up at 7 am, and headed into Mudgee on a coffee run. We drove about 10 minutes to the Dancing Goat, where we ordered 9 coffees (including a coffee for ourselves). </p><p>The Dancing Goat was a cute coffee shop, which seemed to be family owned and run. There were kids under 12 working as the Hostess and the Cashier. We immediately felt bad for our large order, but it didn&#x27;t matter because they handled it rather well. The coffees came out in under 10 minutes, hand delivered to us in two very stable carry trays. </p><p>After returning back to the house and eating breakfast with coffee, we headed off on a wine tour with Scotty (an employee of Adam). He picked us up at 9.35 am to which we arrived at our first winery for the day: </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-heslop">1. Heslop:<a href="#1-heslop" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Heslop:" title="Direct link to 1. Heslop:">‚Äã</a></h3><p>When we arrived (~9.50 am), I was thinking that we would have to wait until they open (usually 10 am?), but they let us start early. As we walked through the front Garden, we arrived at a house. There were two people who greeted us - a woman named Julie, of about 65-70 years and a male of about 40 years of age, named Liam. They were a mother and son duo. They also mentioned that there was another member, Bob (Julie&#x27;s husband) but he was currently constructing a new wine cellar.  </p><p>They led us into a small cosy room, decorated with a wide variety of wines. Julie was leading the wine tour and she allowed us to try a wide range (7-10 wines) of wines, with 95% of the grapes grown on site (the other 5% were grown as Bunnamagoo). Some wines of interest was the vermentino. We later learned that Vermentino is a grape that is trying to replace the Savignon Blanc (from NZ), as the acidity can be better controlled. The Rose, and Zinfandel were also pretty amazing wines and the best of Mudgee. </p><p>Although, Zinfandel (I knew nothing about this grape variety previously), is a grape grown in California. Liam (the wine maker) spent 1 year abroad in California and fell in love with &quot;Zin&quot; and decided to invest in it. They now are one of a few wineries that grow Zinfandel in Mudgee. </p><p>As we were deciding of the wines to buy, Julie said &quot;If you are saving yourself for the rest of the day because you think they might get better.... let me tell you, they  don&#x27;t. They are not as good as here.&quot; She was right. They were the best wines of the day to which I later (Monday) voted them the best Wine cellar of Mudgee. </p><p>We purchased 3 bottles from Heslop, including 2x Vermentino&#x27;s and 1x Shiraz. I will put this winery on my list to return to next time I visit Mudgee. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-bunnamagoo">2. Bunnamagoo:<a href="#2-bunnamagoo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Bunnamagoo:" title="Direct link to 2. Bunnamagoo:">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The next place was <em>Bunnamagoo</em>. It was more of a commercial vineyard, yet it had a really pretty lookout onto the landscape. Most of the white wines I did not enjoy here... Until we got to the reds. The reds were quite enjoyable and we ended up buying a Cabernet Shiraz Merlot and a Shiraz which was so delicious! Funny story though, as we were loading the van with our wines, Nick set off the fire extinguisher. It let out a whole lot of foam, which everyone joked about for the rest of the day. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-huntington">3. Huntington:<a href="#3-huntington" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Huntington:" title="Direct link to 3. Huntington:">‚Äã</a></h3><p><em>Huntington</em> followed. It was also a very pretty vineyard. Lots of bushery and trees still containing their &#x27;autumn leaves.&#x27; When we entered the cellar, we were escorted upstairs to a medium sized room, with a long, narrow, wooden table to seat 11. We sat on wooden stools and a tall guy (sorry I do not recall his name) talked us through the wines. Attached to the room was a bathroom. From where I was sitting I could clearly see a bathtub and a shower. Over the bath was a long board and wine bottles stacked atop. It seemed like it was an old converted house where they did wine tastings. </p><p>The wines here were nicer than Bunnamagoo (in my opinion). Some noteworthy wines were the Chardonnay which I finally realised, has a certain butteriness to it. I had heard people comment about the butteriness of Chardonnays but I never really tasted it or realised this taste until now! All the reds were again very nice, and we ended up buying a Shiraz Cabernet. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-moothi-estate">4. Moothi Estate<a href="#4-moothi-estate" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Moothi Estate" title="Direct link to 4. Moothi Estate">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The next place we showed up at was <em>Moothi Estate.</em> It was meant to be for lunch, but the only thing on their menu were cheese boards and fries. Their service was also very slow. Later I was informed that it was shutting down the next day.¬†Nevertheless, this place was not memorable for me. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-craigmoor-and-burnbrae-vineyards">5. Craigmoor and Burnbrae Vineyards<a href="#5-craigmoor-and-burnbrae-vineyards" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. Craigmoor and Burnbrae Vineyards" title="Direct link to 5. Craigmoor and Burnbrae Vineyards">‚Äã</a></h3><p>We went to a few more places after this, including <em>Craigmoor</em> and <em>Burnbrae Vineyards</em>. There was nothing really memorable about these places. For one thing, the staff at Craigmoor were very distracted, and did not explain much of the wines. This is most likely due to everyone getting to choose their own wines and our wine conniseur trying to meet everyones needs. The staff at Burnbrae were very nice, however, by this point we were so tired and I was almost sick with each sip of wine. However, we did buy a bottle from here, as usual, a Shiraz. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/mudgee2-a33cd78aefa7bb9124c6a9b99a1aeaa1.jpeg" width="1280" height="638" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img Caption: A few pics of my favourite wineries of the day</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="some-notes">Some notes<a href="#some-notes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Some notes" title="Direct link to Some notes">‚Äã</a></h3><p>I have a few observatory notes about the wineries and vineyards around Mudgee: </p><ol><li>You will always pay a Wine Tasting fee regardless of the amount of wine that you buy. </li><li>The wines are cheaper than those in the Hunter Valley. </li><li>It is a different vibe, less laid back than the Hunter Valley. </li><li>It was less touristy than the Hunter Valley. </li><li>Maybe a little more &quot;snobby&quot; about the wines here. </li></ol><p>I also want to comment that five wineries in one day is TOO MUCH. I already knew this before hand, but I must stress this here. After the first three, the wines felt like a chore to drink and I enjoyed them far less. It was very annoying that we arrived back so late (close to 5 pm), and I was feeling very stressed that I could not run or do anything else aside from drink wine. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="monday-10-june-2024"><em>Monday 10 June 2024</em><a href="#monday-10-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to monday-10-june-2024" title="Direct link to monday-10-june-2024">‚Äã</a></h4><p>We slept in until 8 am. My legs were hurting a little bit, maybe from laying down for so long, or the lack of training over this weekend. We got up, dressed, and cleaned the kitchen from last nights pizza&#x27;s and then headed into Mudgee for breakfast. </p><p>We were planning to go back to the Dancing Goat, however, when we parked, there were lots of people lined up waiting for a seat and therefore, we decided to go somewhere else. We ended up going to Alby and Esters. It was a cute cafe in a garden. There were street side seating, then once you walked through a short alley way, there was an open garden filled with tables, and two different indoor seating areas. It was a rather large space for dinning in. When we walked in, it was pretty busy but we still managed to get a seat inside. It was noisy inside but since it was pretty cold (under 10 degrees), we decided to stay put. </p><p>We ordered coffees (strong) and breakfast: Poached eggs for me and a jaffle for Nick. It was a nice breakfast. Our meals came with a side of tomato relish which gave the eggs more flavour. The tomato relish was amazing, which we later realised that they made themselves, with jars onsale to the public. I commented about how we should eat tomato relish more often. I noted that I should add it to our breakfast rolls. </p><p>After breakfast, we ordered  another coffee and a lemon + blueberry (gluten free) cake. It was an enjoyable morning and we left the cafe with full bellies. We returned back to the house at 10.30 am but we were straight out of the door again as the gang wanted to go to the Cheese shop. We headed to High Valley Cheese Co. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="high-valley-cheese-co">High Valley Cheese Co.<a href="#high-valley-cheese-co" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to High Valley Cheese Co." title="Direct link to High Valley Cheese Co.">‚Äã</a></h3><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/mudgee4-b85a46c9613811ea692404d026934163.jpeg" width="1280" height="462" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img Caption: Cheese tasting at High Valley Cheese Co.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The High Valley Cheese Co. is located very close to Mudgee town,maybe 5 mins or so. It is clearly visible from the road. It was a rather small shop located on a large property. The shop fit about 10 people at one time (very squashed). The cool thing was that the cheese tastings here were free! This is the only tasting that we have been to thus far that has been free. </p><p>We tried a range of cheeses, from feta to cheddar and blue cheese. They were very tasty. I didn&#x27;t have much of an appetite when we arrived and so I did not try the Feta. However, I was told that it was delicious and there were many people in the group who bought one of the Feta variations. The other cheeses that we tasted included the Caerphilly, Smoked Cheddar, Smoked Chilli cheddar, Brie, Rouge, Stefan Blue and Coil Y Blue. All the cheese were enjoyable aside from the last one. The Coil Y Blue literally tasted like a farm (but I do not enjoy blue cheese). </p><p>As there were 11 people in our group, there was a backlog of people lining up, and the line spanned out a few meters. I later thought to myself that I would hate to stand in that line, because it moved very slowly. But the cheese conniseurs were very good at their job and it was my favourite tasting today!!!</p><p>We ended up buying the Smoky cheddar cheese and the Rouge. The smoky cheddar was so smoky!

We tried a variety of Gins and Liqueurs, which we were informed were all made onsite. Even the waxing of the bottles was done onsite.
The tasting list consisted of: </p><ul><li>XLCR Gin: This tasted like a normal Gin to me, and I am not a huge fan, however Nick loved it! </li><li>Shiraz Gin: Was better but still not my style. The taste was improved when mixed with a grapefruit soda. </li><li>#Orancello: This was pretty amazing. Exactly like lemoncello, just with orange.

The entrace pathway was about 10 m long, with large barrels, of a rusty brown colour on either side.

From my <a href="/blog/2024/May/spinach_cheese_triangles">previous post</a>, I prepared puff pastry with flour, butter and water. The puff pastry was then used to make spinach and cheese triangles. They were very nice, but the pastry was very sweet. Therefore, I wanted to create a recipe that was less sweet and more to my tastes. To achieve this, I decreased the amount of butter and added oil and extra salt. </p><p>The ingredients were as follows: </p><div align="center"> 400 g plain flour <br> 1 tsp salt <br> 53 g butter <br> 1 tbsp olive oil <br> 155 g water <br> </div><p><em>Method:</em>
In a large mixing bowl, the flour and salt were combined. Butter was chopped into small squares and using my hands, the flour and butter were rubbed together creating a crumbly flour. Next, the oil was added and the flour/butter mixture and oil were gently rubbed together (now, the texture was more crumbly). Finally, I added 155 g water (Note, I weight out the water, but it would equate to 155 mL). and used my hands to mix. The mixture was crumbly, but good enough to roll out. With floured hands and a lightly floured surface, I rolled the dough out into a long, thin pastry (maybe 0.5 cm thick?). Next I folded it several times onto itself and covered in plastic wrap. The covered dough was placed in the fridge.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pastry2-9f2e8275824cd100584942f5cd58d64f.jpeg" width="1280" height="383" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: From preparing the crumbling dough by rubbing ingredients together, to rolling out the dough and folding it into a plastic wrap</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I think 2 hours is adequate enough to chill the pastry, however, I left it in the fridge until I wanted to use it. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="further-preparation">Further preparation<a href="#further-preparation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Further preparation" title="Direct link to Further preparation">‚Äã</a></h2><p><em>2.6.24</em><br>
I pulled the dough out of the fridge and unwrapped it. There were folding marks present, however once I rolled it out with a rolling pin, the dough became smooth again. I tried to roll it out as thin as I could and then cut it into three sections. One filled the inside of a pan, and the other is to act as a pie top (for dinner tomorrow night, see image 1 below). Both were covered and placed in the fridge again. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pastry3-8e28a7de5c3324474ce20bb3bc1581a4.jpeg" width="1280" height="554" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: Preparation of a pie (left) and the cheese triangles after baking (right)</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cheese-trianges">Cheese trianges<a href="#cheese-trianges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cheese trianges" title="Direct link to Cheese trianges">‚Äã</a></h3><p>With the third section, I divided it into five small triangles. 1 tsp of filling was placed in the centre of each triangle and then it was folded onto itself several times to make a triangle like shape.

As a condition of PhD submission, you needed to send through a form including five nominated examiners. Jadranka was one of them. At this point, I am not sure if she was my reviewer but I admire her a lot and if she was, I am hoping that she enjoyed reading my thesis.</p><p>Recently, Jadrank&#x27;s group released a paper, where they synthesised a polymer brush or &quot;<em>graft</em> copolymer. A polymer brush looks like a bottlebrush plant on the molecular level. In this work, 3-hexylthiophene was polymerised using chemical oxidation with  FeCl<sub>3</sub>. Following, 2-thiophene acetic acid was added to the reaction mixture to create a carboxylic acid terminated group. The carboxylic acid groups were then grafted to a gelatin polymer using EDC/NHS coupling. This method covalently cross-links a carboxylic acid with a terminal amine group, forming a peptide bond. The % of P3HT in the graft copolymer was determined to be 9.05% using UV-vis spectroscopy. A calibration curve of P3HT was generated, which allowed the mass to be determined and thus the overall wt % in the polymer. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/graft_cp-e3c2d29b1b2b60c036e36b475a20041f.jpeg" width="1280" height="703" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">*Fig 1. (a) Synthesis of P3HT from 3HT via chemical oxidation and then reaction with 2-thiopheneacetic acid, (b) covalent attachment of P3HT to gelatin to create a brush structure.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now, when I think of polymer brush, I think of good mechanical properties (see <a href="/science/polymer-science/structures/molecular-polymer-brushes">Molecular Polymer Brushes</a>)! Which means these types of materials could be used as potential pressure sensors.The conjugated nature of P3HT also means that it can be used as an electronic device.</p><p>Through a THF/H<sub>2</sub>O cosolvent, thin films (9.05 wt% P3HT) were dropcast on Au electrodes. The conductivity of this system was determined to be 1.64 ¬± 0.02 x 10<sup>-7</sup> S/cm. In contrast, a second copolymer that contained 1.23% P3HT, exhibited &quot;no appreciable conductivity&quot; likely due to the poor network formation or intercalation of the alkyl chains of P3HT to prevent interchain charge transport. Exposure to a collagenase type II allowed for cleavage of the peptide bonds between the gelatin and P3HT. The hydrophobicity of P3HT meant that it would form spherical nanoparticles once the polymer brush degraded, with gelatin as the hydrophillic polymer, forming a corona around the particle and preventing toxicity from the P3HT. </p><p>Now, this work is cool. I love groups that do little tricks to make new polymers from existing stuff. However, I see study after study that create new materials or do some neat chemistries and it ends up nowhere. We already know the importance of biofunctionalising conducting polymers to create better biocompatible materials for a biointerface. I&#x27;d like to see someone commercialise this stuff! or create a device with it. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reference">Reference<a href="#reference" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reference" title="Direct link to Reference">‚Äã</a></h3><p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.4c02174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sun, X.;  Chan, E.

Do you agree? Well about 5-10% of you will not agree. This is because gluten intolerance is a fairly prevalent allergy. Celiac disease is the name given to a gluten intolerance, which is diagnosed in about 1% of people wordwide. People with this disease experience vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, numbness in the hands and feet among many other symptoms, in response to gluten ingestion. Why does this occur?</p><p>Celiac disease is commonly inherited through the genes. One genetic marker of celiac is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genotype. About 30% of people will express this genotype, however, only 1-3% of people will develop the disease. These two genes present on Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) to produce an immune response when exposed to peptides from Gliadin.</p><p>As I explained in my previous bread post, gluten is composed of gliadin, which is the harmful component to people with celiac. Gliadin is difficult to digest, even in healthy humans, due to the presence of prolamins (a group of plant storage proteins). These proteins are generally hydrophobic (or water-hating), with the central region composed mostly of glutamine and proline amino acids. As a result, gliaden will pass into the intestinal barrier. The presence of gliadin in the small intestine produces an inflammtory response, where cells will release tissue transamidase (tTG), often the reason why we would experience bloating in response to breads. tTg expression is increased in celliac sufferers.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/t-tg-89320866901139e2a22b9e89b7763514.jpg" width="849" height="622" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 1.

This cross-linking is an important step that leads to insoluble protein aggregates, which can be cleared from the body. However, it can also convert glutamine to glutamic acid in a process called deamidation. </p><p>Deamidation of gliadin produces negatively charged peptides at physiological pH (7.4-7.6), which then has a high affinity for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. The binding of the glutamic acid to the HLA proteins, results in T-cell stimulation, followed by release of proinflammatory cytokines. This inflammatory response leads to the destruction of the intestinal villi, which are responsible for absorbing nutrients.In addition, people with celliac disease, antibodies are produced in response to the tTG release, further invoking the limitation in gliadin digestion and thus, increasing the prevalence of inflammation. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">‚Äã</a></h3><ol><li>Sha, X., et al., The prolamins, from structure, property, to the function in encapsulation and delivery of bioactive compounds.

One of the requirements of this position is to maintain the ICP (Fig 1). Therefore, I decided to write a short post here about ICP, which I will update with the various things that I have learned along the way. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/icp-fig-2-03dffa70c83f6fd9a547e4522d46aa62.jpg" width="4713" height="2884" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 1.

In ICP-MS, the ions are directly measured. In contract, ICP-OES uses an optical spectrometer to measure the photons emitted as they pass through the plasma. While both methods are extremely fast to use, cheap and straightforward, the ICP-OES has a higher sensitivity to detection. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-icp-work">How does ICP work?<a href="#how-does-icp-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does ICP work?" title="Direct link to How does ICP work?">‚Äã</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Schematic of ICP" src="/assets/images/fig1-icp-b973c0fd8a33d264862421400b87c4e1.jpeg" width="1280" height="462" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Figure 2.

Images taken from (Hou and Jones) and (McCurdy and Potter)</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>A schematic of an ICP is displayed in Fig 2. The liquid sample is injected into a spray chamber which is converted to an aerosol via a nebuliser. During this process, only the very fine particles are injected into the inductor. In the inductor, the sample aerosol is further dried and vapourised due to the high temperatures (10000 K) in the sample carrier. In this process, all chemical bonds are broken, allowing for the vapourisation of each individual atom (Fig 2b). The free atoms collide with plasma, allowing them to transition to an excited state. Upon relaxation to ground state, the ions/atoms will emit a photon of characteristic energies, which can be used to determine the elemental origin of the ions. The total number of photons emitted is proportional to the concentration.</p><p>The ionisation plasma is typically argon gas as it is chemically inert and contains a high proportion of cations and electrons with a high electron density. In the set up shown in Fig 2a, radiofrequency (RF) is applied to a coil which produces ‚Äúseed‚Äù electrons which are accelerated and collide with argon gas to form argon plasma and electrons:</p><p align="center"> Ar(g) ‚Üí Ar<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-sample-preparation">About sample preparation<a href="#about-sample-preparation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to About sample preparation" title="Direct link to About sample preparation">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Solubilised solutions (aqueous or organic) are required to perform ICP analysis. Therefore, samples (&lt;0.2 %&gt;) are typically treated with nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) or HCl, in a process referred to as &quot;acid digestion&quot;.  Sample concentrations of &lt;0.2% are crucial to avoid any matrix effects.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="matrix-effects">Matrix effects<a href="#matrix-effects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Matrix effects" title="Direct link to Matrix effects">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Matrix effects are interferences in the analysis due ton signal dift caused by the deposition of solids on the sample apertures or signal suppression caused by salt ions. The typical salt interference is caused by oxide formation, which seems to reduce the ion flow and promotes clogging at the sample cone (the interface that analyses ion extraction). With years of research, matrix effects have typically solved through the use of OES compared to MS. ICP-OES relies on photon emission rather than ion acceleration, which makes it less susceptible to interferences. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advantages-of-icp-compared-to-other-elemental-analyses">Advantages of ICP compared to other elemental analyses<a href="#advantages-of-icp-compared-to-other-elemental-analyses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advantages of ICP compared to other elemental analyses" title="Direct link to Advantages of ICP compared to other elemental analyses">‚Äã</a></h2><p>As ICP heats to very high temperatures, samples undergo more efficient vaporisation, atomisation and excitation. This allows for a wider range of elements to be analysed by ICP. In addition, the high temperature means that there is less water vapour present, in turn reducing the concentration of oxygen species and thus a lower level of matrix interferences caused by oxide formation. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">‚Äã</a></h2><ol><li>Ammann, A.A., Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS): a versatile tool.

I have been reading so much and redoing all my figures/analyses. Each day, I started work at 7 am and continued until 10 pm. I even spent all my weekends working on it. Until finally, I felt proud of my thesis! Now, it is being reviewed by one of my supervisors. </p><p>The plan now is to write a couple of research papers.
