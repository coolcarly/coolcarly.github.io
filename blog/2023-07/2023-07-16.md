It's been really busy lately. For my PhD, I have been doing a lot of Raman Spectroscopy to characterise my materials in my project. I have also been writing a manuscript. Finally, on Friday, I submitted the manuscipt to my supervisors. 

I am feeling nervous about the manuscript, and that they will not read it. Only last Thursday, David asked me about a manuscript. I told him it was on the way. So hopefully, since I've sent it through, they will all read it and give me helpful feedback. 

In other news, I've been practicing surfing only a little. Yesterday, I stood up consistently for waves. My shoulder still hurts but it is getting better, slowly. 


Also, a long awaited comment bar has now been introduced into each side-bar home.
