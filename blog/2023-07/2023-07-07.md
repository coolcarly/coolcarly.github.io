Through Rainbow Club (A swim club that I used to work for), I was offered tickets to see the Dragons vs. the Raiders at Win Stadium in Wollongong. Tonight, Nick and I caught the train to Wollongong, had a few beers and dinner at the Illawarra Brewing Co. and then headed to the stadium to watch the game.

Our seats were not the best. The whole first half of the game, the ball was down the opposite end of the field (as Raiders had majority possession). I was excited for the second half, thinking that Raiders would be mostly down our end. HOwever, during the second half, Dragons had majority possession and scored at least 4 tries to make it almost even. 

A few other families from Rainbow Club attended the match too. I got to catch up with them, which was really nice. I do miss the people at Rainbow Club. It's just a shame that I do not enjoy teaching anymore. THe thought of spending 3 hours in the cold, chlorinated pool does not make me feel good.
