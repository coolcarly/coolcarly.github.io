Lately, I have been freaking out with the amount of work still left in my PhD. Today, I had planned to have a writing day but I realised as I opened various thesis chapters, that I have actually written a lot! At 11 am, I decided to head into the lab to try to resynthesise a monomer for my second research chapter. While searching the freezer for my materials, I came across a molecule that I had synthesised previously, but never used. It was a dibromo-compound that was initially synthesised for a grignard reaction. 

For fun, I set up a 1 mL (200 mg) scale [direct arylation polymerisation](/science/polymer-science/synthesis/darp). For the rest of the day, I felt so happy and accomplished. I feel so excited to work this polymer up and characterise it. 

To hear more about this, and see the fun I have with these reactions, visit [side projects](/phd/side-projects).
