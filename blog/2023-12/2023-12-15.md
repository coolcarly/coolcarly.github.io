It's been just over a month since I've wrote something in my blog. 

For the last month and a half, I have been working through the comments that I received back. It's been a real tough time, because there were a lot of comments. I honestly felt like everything I knew about my topic was wrong. I have been reading so much and redoing all my figures/analyses. Each day, I started work at 7 am and continued until 10 pm. I even spent all my weekends working on it. Until finally, I felt proud of my thesis! Now, it is being reviewed by one of my supervisors. 

The plan now is to write a couple of research papers. However, my current dilemma is that I dont want to write a paper if my supervisors do not agree with what I wrote in my thesis.
