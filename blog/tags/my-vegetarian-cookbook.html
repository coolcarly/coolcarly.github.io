tonight, I wanted to prepare a couple of Greek Gyros, inspired by <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/greek-chicken-gyros-with-tzatziki/#wprm-recipe-container-21826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recipetineats</a>. Tofu was an option to use as the main protein content, however, tofu is very soft and wouldn&#x27;t go well with a wrap of this sort (to my opinion). Therefore, tempeh was the next best thing.</p><p>Previously, I attempted to cook tempeh, however, it turned out terrible! It is a very tough soy-based protein, so if it is not cooked properly, then it won&#x27;t be very tasty. </p><p>I read several blogs, saying that you can bake it as is.. Others say you need to steam it. I decided to go with steaming. I did about 20-30 minutes of steaming. Even after 30 minutes, it felt tough! Now I realise that 15 minutes would have been sufficient as later baking makes it softer. </p><p>After steaming the tempeh, it was marinated with oregano (1 tsp), yogurt (2 tbsp), lemon juice (1 tbsp), salt (1 tsp) and pepper (1/4 tsp). I allowed it to soak up the marinate for 1 hour before I baked the tempeh. Usually, I would let the marinade soak for 3 hours min, however, as the tempeh was hot and the proteins somewhat denatured from the steaming, I thought that 1 hour was sufficient enough to allow the tempeh to absorb the flavour.</p><p>The tempeh was placed in an oven proof dish (trying to conserve the marinate in the dish) and baked for 10 minutes at 220 ¬∞C, mixed with the excess marinade and then baked for another 10 minutes. </p><p>The tempeh was then used as a chicken substitue in a wrap, with a homemade tzatzkiki and flatbread. </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHMIEHjhjxs?si=faVa6XkIVwEvP7TV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/my-vegetarian-cookbook">my vegetarian cookbook</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/cooking">cooking</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/tempeh">tempeh</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2024/June/pastry">Puff pastry</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-06-03T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 3, 2024</time> ¬∑ <!-- -->4 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="preparation-of-the-pastry">Preparation of the pastry<a href="#preparation-of-the-pastry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Preparation of the pastry" title="Direct link to Preparation of the pastry">‚Äã</a></h2><p><em>1.6.24</em><br>
From my <a href="/blog/2024/May/spinach_cheese_triangles">previous post</a>, I prepared puff pastry with flour, butter and water. The puff pastry was then used to make spinach and cheese triangles. They were very nice, but the pastry was very sweet. Therefore, I wanted to create a recipe that was less sweet and more to my tastes. To achieve this, I decreased the amount of butter and added oil and extra salt. </p><p>The ingredients were as follows: </p><div align="center"> 400 g plain flour <br> 1 tsp salt <br> 53 g butter <br> 1 tbsp olive oil <br> 155 g water <br> </div><p><em>Method:</em>
In a large mixing bowl, the flour and salt were combined. Butter was chopped into small squares and using my hands, the flour and butter were rubbed together creating a crumbly flour. Next, the oil was added and the flour/butter mixture and oil were gently rubbed together (now, the texture was more crumbly). Finally, I added 155 g water (Note, I weight out the water, but it would equate to 155 mL). and used my hands to mix. The mixture was crumbly, but good enough to roll out. With floured hands and a lightly floured surface, I rolled the dough out into a long, thin pastry (maybe 0.5 cm thick?). Next I folded it several times onto itself and covered in plastic wrap. The covered dough was placed in the fridge.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pastry2-9f2e8275824cd100584942f5cd58d64f.jpeg" width="1280" height="383" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: From preparing the crumbling dough by rubbing ingredients together, to rolling out the dough and folding it into a plastic wrap</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I think 2 hours is adequate enough to chill the pastry, however, I left it in the fridge until I wanted to use it. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="further-preparation">Further preparation<a href="#further-preparation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Further preparation" title="Direct link to Further preparation">‚Äã</a></h2><p><em>2.6.24</em><br>
I pulled the dough out of the fridge and unwrapped it. There were folding marks present, however once I rolled it out with a rolling pin, the dough became smooth again. I tried to roll it out as thin as I could and then cut it into three sections. One filled the inside of a pan, and the other is to act as a pie top (for dinner tomorrow night, see image 1 below). Both were covered and placed in the fridge again. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pastry3-8e28a7de5c3324474ce20bb3bc1581a4.jpeg" width="1280" height="554" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: Preparation of a pie (left) and the cheese triangles after baking (right)</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cheese-trianges">Cheese trianges<a href="#cheese-trianges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cheese trianges" title="Direct link to Cheese trianges">‚Äã</a></h3><p>With the third section, I divided it into five small triangles. 1 tsp of filling was placed in the centre of each triangle and then it was folded onto itself several times to make a triangle like shape. The triangles were placed in the oven to bake for 30 minutes.  </p><p>The filling consisted of: </p><div align="center"> 1/4 cup ricotta <br> 1/4 cup crumbled feta <br>  pinch of nutmeg + pepper <br> 1/4 cup tasty cheese<br> sprinkle of bread crumbs <br> 1 egg <br></div><p>I have to say, I enjoyed this pastry!

Mixture was cooled for a few minutes.</p><p>The mushroom mixture was added to a bowl filled with ricotta, feta, tasty cheese and egg. The mixture was stirred and then transferred to the baking dish containing the pastry. Next, the second sheet of pastry was placed on top and the edges were joined together using a fork.

Over the past few weeks, I have had the desire to improve my baking skills, so I have invested time into making a perfect loaf of bread. With every small tweak in a recipe, I realised that there are dramatic changes, which motivated me to write about the changes in bread quality in relation to the chemistry. </p><p>Flour contains proteins glutenin and gliadin, which combine in the presence of water to form gluten (Fig 1). Prior to the addition of water, glutenin exists as a colloid. Upon addition of water to the flour, the chains are allowed to stretch, seperate, and form new disulfide linkages. These disulfide linkages create a network of glutenin polymer that produces the strength and elasticity of bread dough. At the same time, the smaller gliadin proteins will disperse through the glutenin polymer network, which allows the bread to &quot;rise&quot;. It is the constituent that facilitates formation of the gluten network. Due to it&#x27;s self-assembling properties (as it is highly hydrophobic), it will associate into spherical particles and absorb other nutrients such as vitamin E. Thus, the quality of the gluten network that forms is dependent on the type of flour that is used.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Schematic of gluten formation" src="/assets/images/bread_schematic-2d7f68f1f1f8c5e36c0a766763aedc22.jpeg" width="1280" height="453" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 1. Schematic of gluten formation</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Mixing and kneading of the flour/water mixture encourages the gluten network to further develop. During this process, carbon dioxide is incorporated, producing a more porous dough once it is baked. Yet, we dont want the gluten networks to be so strong that they become chewy and tough. This is the reason that people turn to a &quot;no-knead&quot; method. Sometimes, a high water content is enough to facilitate formation of strong gluten networks. </p><p>Yet, there is one more ingredient that is required to create the gluten network... and that is salt. As mentioned in the <a href="/science/salt">&quot;salting-out&quot;</a> post, salt helps to decrease the water content. In this instance, salt will remove water from the protein/polymer network to increase the strength and elasicity. </p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="making-the-initial-loaf">Making the initial loaf<a href="#making-the-initial-loaf" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Making the initial loaf" title="Direct link to Making the initial loaf">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The initial recipe that I started with came from Nagi: <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-yeast-bread-recipe-no-knead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RecipeTinEats</a>. The ingredients required were:</p><p align="center"> 450 g flour <br> 2 tsp yeast <br> 2 tsp salt <br> 375 mL of warm watern (~40 ¬∞C) </p><p>First, I started off with a &quot;no kneading&quot; approach to bread making. I was unsure of the measurements for the yeast. I had the large container of active yeast as well as the packets. I initially used the packets, and with a quick google search I saw that 7 g was an equivalent of 2 tsp of yeast. Therefore, in my first attempt to make this bread, I activated one packet of the yeast in warm water. The bread was left for a few hours in a warm-ish environment to rise, and then it was moulded into a round ball and baked using the dutch oven.</p><p>After baking, the bread was very tough to cut and very dense, but it was still quite tasty and full of flavour. These bread flavours arise from fermentation. The high density is possibly attributed to a low water content. Thus, for the subsequent loaves, I went for weighing out the ingredients using a scale instead of the &quot;cups&quot; measurement as a scale is more accurate. </p><p>A few days later, I used the recommended amount of yeast (2 tsp), weighed out the flour (450 g to be exact) and the water. I saw that the dough was still a bit &quot;doughy&quot;, so I added an extra 20 mL of water to the batch (395 mL in total). It was too sticky to be able to knead (Fig 2, img1), yet it felt very soft and after allowing it to rise for several hours, I baked it using the dutch oven. NOTE: I was sure that it had risen well, when the dough (before baking) was very bubbly on the surface and small movements of the bowl containing the dough resulted in a &quot;jiggling&quot; of the dough surface. This time, it rose more than the previous batch (likely due to the extra yeast) and was less dense than the last batch (owing to the excess water added).</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="second batch" src="/assets/images/bread2-19d89ba343b4abe8ec1492f13ad64569.jpeg" width="1280" height="416" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 2. Batch 2: (img 1) sticky dough, (img 2) moulded dough for baking, (img 3) final product.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Without a job at this point, I wanted to bake more and change the conditions to geet the best loaf. I wondered what is the impact of leaving the dough to sit for longer? What is the impact of kneading? Surely I can google this, but I wanted to experience the feeling and taste differences. Therefore, the next batch that I made, was using the same contents as above only, I allowed the dough to sit for 3 hours at room temperature, then 2 days in the fridge (covered). The day before cooking, I pulled out the dough, moulded it into a ball and allowed it to sit covered in plastic wrap in the fridge overnight. When I baked this loaf, it rose slightly more than the last batch, and was also more porous (Fig 3). From what I understand, it seems that when you put the dough in the fridge, fermentation is slowed down to allow the development of more complex flavours.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="optimising-a-few-conditions">Optimising a few conditions<a href="#optimising-a-few-conditions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Optimising a few conditions" title="Direct link to Optimising a few conditions">‚Äã</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="third batch" src="/assets/images/bread-3-688d4025dcac098afd75278bf7cd9fd2.jpeg" width="1280" height="637" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 3.

Therefore, a dough was prepared as previous, however, it was kneaded for 5 minutes of before allowing the dough to rise. Due to the better properties of the previous batch of bread, the dough was immediately placed in the fridge, in a covered bowel. The dough was left for close to 22 hours in the fridge. The dough appeared to have similar textures as the previous batch, however, was less soft upon touching it.</p><p>The dough was moulded and scored (using tips that I got from <a href="https://vegpatchkitchen.co.uk/what-is-oven-spring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegpatchkitchen</a>) and baked from it&#x27;s cold state. The idea behind scoring is that it allows the gases to uniformly escape, making bread the rise more uniform, instead of having that weird bubble in the middle of the loaf (as seen in img 2 of Fig 3).</p><p>While the final bread loaf in Fig 4 (img 3) appears to be more uniform, without the ugly bubble in the middle, it was less porous than batch 3 (Fig 3). This was attributed to the small additions of flour that I added in order to knead the bread. As small amounts of excess flour decreases the water content, the bread ultimately became more dense. I thought this bread was the tastiest and best looking so far. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="fourth batch" src="/assets/images/bread4-c1294227c25e4d5f5ce68565394cd866.jpeg" width="1280" height="427" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 4.

First, 4 tsp of dried yeast was added to 2 cups of warm water (equivalent to 427 g of water). The yeast was allowed to grow for 5 minutes and then added to the flour/salt mixture. The mixture was combined with a wooden spoon. As it appeared to be very flaky and floury, an extra 229 g of water was added. It appeared to be very slicky and slimy. It was too sticky to be kneaded, or even handled.

I allowed it to sit in the fridge while it defrosted. The appearance was no different to when I put it in the freezer, however, it seemed to have less structural integrity (i.e. everytime I tried to mould it into a ball, overtime it would loss the shape). At 4.30pm, I begun preparing the oven to bake the dough. I popped it in for another half an hour bake, followed by 15 minutes without the lid.</p><p>When I pulled it out of the oven, it had a very large circumference which is consistent with the dough losing its shape. It rose a bit, but was not as inflated as previous. I suspect that some of the yeast died when it was frozen and to compensate for this, I shouldve added extra yeast to the batch. The bread was hard on the outside and soft on the inside, just like I like it. It was very porous and tasted good. I think this bread was great overall. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/bread-20240530-a16ee25a5d1ae99111d0ec6ca8cb3d77.svg" width="2406" height="784" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 6.

I attributed the poor shape to yeast dying during the freezing process. This enticed me to use more yeast this time, as I plan to freeze it. </p><p><em>Method</em>
To the yeast, add the warm water and a pinch of sugar. Wait 5-10 minutes for the yeast to foam (I love this part! It&#x27;s like I am controlling my own little world). Add all dry ingredients to a bowl. Mix around and add the water/yeast mixture. Stir through. (Note: the mixture will be very wet. That is great. The more wet or sticky it is, the more porous it will be! Although I&#x27;m not sure how freezing will affect this though) and cover for 3 hours. (Note: I put my dough in the microwave, seems to be a warm spot). </p><p>After 3 hours, I pulled the dough out of the bowl, a lightly covered with flour, being careful not to press it (i.e. knead) too much. Next, I placed it in a bread bag, allowing a little bit of air in and room for the dough to still grow and then put into the freezer where it will sit for a few days. I plan to bake it sometime next week. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1462024-"><em>14.6.2024</em> <br><a href="#1462024-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1462024-" title="Direct link to 1462024-">‚Äã</a></h3><p>On Tuesday 11.6.24, I pulled the dough out of the freezer and let it defrost in the fridge for 48 hours. On Thursday 13.6.24, when I arrived home from work, I moulded the bread (using some new bread moulders that I got last week) and baked in a preheated dutch oven. The bread was very tasty, with an even amount of pores. It rose a significant amount, indicating that the yeast was still active. The bread remained soft and fresh tasting for 3 days. I will definitely use this freezing method from now on. </p><p>The next task that I will undertake is crafting sourdough bread. I will begin with making a sourdough startup. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">‚Äã</a></h2><ol><li>Cho, I.H. and D.G.

I had just prepared a butter tofu and rice for dinner, but it was only 5 pm (we usually eat at 6 pm). As I was cleaning up, I had a desire to bake more bread. But I didn&#x27;t want to make anymore bread, especially considering that I still had a dough in the freezer! Therefore, I decided I would make puff pastry for dinner the following night. The initial recipe that I went with wanted 250 g of butter! I cut it down to 170g and added a excess of water and refrigerated for a longer period of time:</p><p align="center"> 250 g flour<br>1/4 tsp salt<br>170 g butter<br>2 cup water<br></p><p><em>extra flour for dusting</em> </p><p></p><p>So basically, I blended the flour and butter to make a crumbly consistency and then the water to create a dough. It was meant to be very crumbly, but because I added too much water, it was very sticky. I needed to compensate by adding more flour. Once the dough was very crumbly, I rolled it out into a long rectangle and then folded several times. I covered it in plastic wrap and placed in the fridge. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="preparing-and-cooking-the-triangles">Preparing and cooking the triangles<a href="#preparing-and-cooking-the-triangles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Preparing and cooking the triangles" title="Direct link to Preparing and cooking the triangles">‚Äã</a></h2><p><em>23.5.24</em> </p><p>Next, I pulled the dough out of the fridge, unwrapped it and rolled it to be a little thinner. I divided it into 6x rectangles. Note: this dough was so sticky that they definitely were not rectangles! I prepared the pastry filling as follows: </p><p align="center">1 Garlic<br>1/2 onion<br>handful of spinach<br>1 tsp bread crumbs<br>1/4 cup tasty cheese<br>1/4 cup mozarella<br>1 egg</p><p>Basically, in about 20 g of butter, I fried up garlic and onion and spinach. It was cooled slightly, then i added all the remaining ingredients and mixed well. </p><p>I then added ~1 heaped table spoon to the pastries and folded as best as I could into triangles.... No they were not triangles, but triangle equivalent?</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pastry1-12817e97a2385f58bc730ee3f755e6dd.svg" width="3644" height="1531" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: Before and after the puff pastries were baked.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h1>What did I learn?</h1><p>The triangles were tasty! However, I will do things differently next time. I will cut out more of the butter if possible and swap for a bit of olive oil oil, so that the flavour more closely resembles pizza dough, rather than biscuits. These pastries were very sweet and so I would have liked to add a bit more salt to make them go well with the savoury filling.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/cooking">cooking</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/bread">bread</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/pastry">pastry</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/my-vegetarian-cookbook">my vegetarian cookbook</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/08/02/2023-08">Garlic &amp; Rosemary Pull apart bread</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-08-02T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 2, 2023</time> ¬∑ <!-- -->3 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It&#x27;s already August! Wow, where has the time gone? Five months left until I need to submit my PhD thesis. </p><p>I arrived home from work after an unsuccessful day in the lab. The electrodes attached to my potentiostat were disfunctioning. I spent my 3 hours of lab time, trying to trouble shoot the problem. With the help of one of the guys in the workshop, I was able to fix the electrode. However, upon a &quot;dummy test&quot;, the signal was not strong. I gave up, and decided to go home and not waste anymore time. </p><p>I arrived home and prepared a quiche for dinner. I was feeling inspired by Emma (as over the weekend, she made a really awesome scrambled eggs). The egg filling alone contained some butter and rosemary. </p><p>After I finished preparing dinner, I was still in the mood to cook - anything to avoid working on my thesis! I decided to prepare tomorrow nights dinner as well. </p><p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I get tired of eating similar things all the time. I feel like it is super boring and not creative at all. While I was having these thoughts, I had finished the rest of our loaf of bread. That&#x27;s when I was inspired to make some bread. </p><p>I remember when I was much younger, around 15 years old and would often bake various things for my family. I enjoyed baking a lot - from bread to cakes. However, I saw so many people around me who were a lot better. I often compared myself to others and it really demotivated me to cook (Yes, I always wanted to be the best). I wonder what life would have been like if I didn&#x27;t compare myself and just did the things that I enjoyed - because I enjoyed them. </p><p>Maybe my enjoyment of baking and &quot;creative cooking&quot; is the reason that I chose chemistry. I always wonder what drove me to stay in chemistry. I usually say that it was because I got the best marks for the least amount of effort - which is probably true. Now, I am thinking that it was also because I was using my hands to create something. Synthesis is very similar to cooking: a step by step process to create something wonderful. </p><p>The funny thing is though, I struggle so much to follow recipes. The same thing applies in the lab: I struggle a lot to follow new synthetic protocols. This caused so much stress during my undergrad: as I didn&#x27;t perform as well as some of the other students. Somehow I have made it through and am almost finished a PhD in chemistry! Sometimes I forget how amazing it is that I&#x27;ve made it this far. Dani had to remind me earlier today when we were discussing my PhD. </p><p>Anyway, the <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/rosemary-garlic-pull-apart-bread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garlic &amp; Rosemary pull apart bread</a> that I made was taken from Sally&#x27;s baking addiction.
