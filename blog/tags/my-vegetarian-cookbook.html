am. At 3 pm, I used the majority of the starter (81 g) to prepare another loaf of sourdough. This time, the loaf was not as dense as the previous one (see <a href="/blog/2024/June/sourdough-bread">my first attempt</a>).

As long as it is left long enough for the yeast to do it&#x27;s magic, I think we are fine. This recipe allows the dough to sit for 35 hours after the initial 4 hour resting period. </p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>

A float test also told me that I left it too long, because it sunk to the bottom of a jar of water. Therefore, I took 24 g of starter at 7.30 am and fed with 55 g flour and 94 g of water. I placed it in the oven which was 25-30 degrees (note: the oven was off, but it is a warm place to allow the sourdough to grow). At 10 am, there were no air bubbles present. I gave it a more vigorous stir and air bubbles began to form. At 12.30 pm, it grew about 1 cm. At 12.45 pm, it passed the float test (compared to the discard, which did not). I placed it in the oven for longer. Also note that I kept the discard and later in the day (4.30 pm), I fed it flour and water.   </p><p>At 1.30 pm, I combined 450 g of all purpose flour and 1 tsp salt. I added 350 g of hot water. I mixed the dough - it was very flaky. I let it cool down to 43 degrees before adding the entirety of the starter (!160 g +- 10 g). After I added the starter, the dough was very wet and hydrated. Note for next time, use less water (250 g). </p><p>The mixture sat in the microwave for 1 hour (“autolyse” period). At 3 pm, I returned and performed 4 x stretch and folds. The dough was so wet that I had to add a small amount of flour. I allowed it to sit for 30 minutes, covered with a tea towel (Bulk fermentation phase). After 30 minutes ( 3 30 pm), I repeated a stretch and fold of the dough. It was very stretchy, but appears to be becoming smoother overtime. </p><p>After 1 hour of bulk fermentation (4 pm), I performed another stretch and fold. It was still very sticky. At 4.30 pm, while it was still sticky, the dough was getting stronger and better holding its shape. I repeated the stretch and fold. At 4.30 pm, I placed the dough into the oven (warm area, not on) and left it until 9 pm. </p><p>When we arrived home at 7.30 pm from seeker brewery, l checked the sourdough and it did not appear to rise too much. Therefore I decided leave it for a little longer. I was a little worried that I would leave it for too long over night. Therefore, I decided at 9pm, to mould the dough. </p><p>I performed some shaping of the dough with my hands and the bread Moulder. I then wrapped the bread in a bread cloth and placed in a mixing bowl and in the fridge overnight. </p><p>At 10 am, I pulled the bread out of the fridge and further shaped the dough on the bread cloth. By pulling the dough along the bench and inducing frictionous movement, the dough became less and less stretchy. I knew I was finished when it would not stretch anymore and it continued to reform its original shape. </p><p>I preheated the oven to 220 °C, and then the Dutch oven for 30 minutes. Following, I placed the dough on baking paper and in the Dutch oven. The bread was baked for 20 minutes with the lid on and 25 minutes with the lid off. </p><p>When I pulled the loaf from the oven, it was quite small. Yet, it did rise a significant amount, indicating that the yeast was active. I forgot to score the loaf. However, the loaf did not break during baking. My initial thoughts were that the loaf is going to be very dense. I let it sit for 20 mins to cool, before cutting into the loaf.</p><p>As I cut into the loaf, it was very soft and easy to cut. However, the bread was also very moist and damp. I think that the water content was too high and I didn’t bake it with the lid on for long enough. Next time, I should do 30 minutes on and 10 mins off. In addition, I definitely need to decrease the water content. As a result of the remaining water, it was more dense than I expected, which gave it a cake-like texture. For days following, the bread remained pretty fresh likely due to that high water density.  </p><p>In terms of smell and taste, it had a sourness to it - as expected. All in all, it was a good attempt at my first loaf of sourdough. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/dough-to-bread-b9b10a270f6a5a382e17b6238d132986.jpeg" width="1280" height="498" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: From dough to bread.</em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/my-vegetarian-cookbook">my vegetarian cookbook</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/sourdough">sourdough</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2024/June/sourdough-starter">Sourdough starter</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-06-29T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 29, 2024</time> · <!-- -->15 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Date created: 17.06.2024; Date modified: 03.07.2024</em> <br>
In order to prepare a sourdough starter, I needed 1 week where I wasn&#x27;t going to be away from home. After the <a href="/blog/2024/June/mudge-24">Mudgee</a> weekend, I decided that this week would be a perfect opportunity to get the starter up and running. What do I mean by a sourdough starter? I mean to grow the bacteria necessary to craft sourdough bread. </p><p>I started with the following equipment/ingredients: </p><ul><li>Rye flour*</li><li>tap water**</li><li>2 x 500 g jars</li><li>food scale</li><li>Paper towel and rubber band (or breathable lid)</li></ul><p><strong>Some general things to note:</strong></p><ul><li>I chose rye flour as the starting flour because it is meant to have a higher level of good bacteria and enzymes to aid in healthy fermentation.</li><li>Some say that you should use bottled water for the initial week (because chlorine is present in tap water, which kills all bacteria). I filled a drink bottle with tap water and left it overnight. By doing this, the chlorine dissapates from the water. You could also use boiled water (cooled down of course).</li><li>The ideal environment is 24–28 °C. As it is winter, sometimes I used warmer water (30°C) and wrapped it in a towel to warm it up.</li><li>While the starter is on the bench at room temperature, you need to cover it with a breathable lid: such as paper towel and rubber band. Once you place it in the fridge (because you are not using it frequently), you can put a lid on (but very loosely). This is because the microorganisms in the starter are constantly converting the carbohydrates/sugars in the flour to carbon dioxide.

Note about the starter: This was a disguard that I kept in the fridge for 2 days. I think it is safe to leave sourdough disguard for 3 days in the fridge, so I wanted to use it before I needed to throw it away. </p><p>NOTE about the hydration: on the 26.06.24: before I added the starter, I added 1/2 cup of water (which I realised was a mistake therefore this recipe is tweaked). After I added the starter, it was very sticky! This was wrong, the consistency should be crumbly. Therefore, it is crucial to add the sourdough starter before extra water, so you correct the consistency. </p><p>Note for step 8: Refrigeration is important for pastry. The colder it is, the better. You want the butter and oil to solidify to bring the crumbly consistency to your pastry. I also think that it will aid in bring flavours out of the sourdough.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/cooking">cooking</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/my-vegetarian-cookbook">my vegetarian cookbook</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/sourdough-starter">sourdough starter</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/sourdough-discard">sourdough discard</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/pancakes">pancakes</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2024/June/sourdough-pancakes">Sourdough Pancakes</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-06-23T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 23, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>On 23.6.24, I used my sourdough discard for the first time.

I will end this post by investigating wheat-based composites (basically mixtures of various wheat and non-wheat based flours).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-bit-of-science-behind-bread">A bit of science behind bread<a href="#a-bit-of-science-behind-bread" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A bit of science behind bread" title="Direct link to A bit of science behind bread">​</a></h2><p><em>9.5.2024</em> <br></p><p>Flour contains proteins glutenin and gliadin, which are hydrophobic (water-hating) peptides. In the presence of water, they will self-assemble to form gluten (Fig 1), which is a result of the molecule preventing the hydrophobic regions from interacting with water. Prior to the addition of water, glutenin exists as a colloid. Upon addition of water to the flour, the chains are allowed to stretch, seperate, and form new disulfide linkages. These disulfide linkages create a network of glutenin polymer that produces the strength and elasticity of bread dough. At the same time, the smaller gliadin proteins will disperse through the glutenin polymer network, which allows the bread to &quot;rise&quot;. It is the constituent that facilitates formation of the gluten network. Due to it&#x27;s self-assembling properties (as it is highly hydrophobic), it will associate into spherical particles and absorb other nutrients such as vitamin E. Thus, the quality of the gluten network that forms is dependent on the type of flour that is used.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Schematic of gluten formation" src="/assets/images/bread_schematic-2d7f68f1f1f8c5e36c0a766763aedc22.jpeg" width="1280" height="453" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 1. Schematic of gluten formation</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Mixing and kneading of the flour/water mixture encourages the gluten network to further develop. During this process, carbon dioxide is incorporated, producing a more porous dough once it is baked. Yet, we dont want the gluten networks to be so strong that they become chewy and tough. This is the reason that people turn to a &quot;no-knead&quot; method. Sometimes, a high water content is enough to facilitate formation of strong gluten networks. </p><p>Yet, there is one more ingredient that is required to create the gluten network... and that is salt. As mentioned in the <a href="/science/salt">&quot;salting-out&quot;</a> post, salt helps to decrease the water content. In this instance, salt will remove water from the protein/polymer network to increase the strength and elasicity. </p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="making-the-initial-loaf">Making the initial loaf<a href="#making-the-initial-loaf" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Making the initial loaf" title="Direct link to Making the initial loaf">​</a></h2><p>The initial recipe that I started with came from Nagi: <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-yeast-bread-recipe-no-knead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RecipeTinEats</a>. The ingredients required were:</p><p align="center"> 450 g flour <br> 2 tsp yeast <br> 2 tsp salt <br> 375 mL of warm watern (~40 °C) </p><p>First, I started off with a &quot;no kneading&quot; approach to bread making. I was unsure of the measurements for the yeast. I had the large container of active yeast as well as the packets. I initially used the packets, and with a quick google search I saw that 7 g was an equivalent of 2 tsp of yeast. Therefore, in my first attempt to make this bread, I activated one packet of the yeast in warm water. The bread was left for a few hours in a warm-ish environment to rise, and then it was moulded into a round ball and baked using the dutch oven.</p><p>After baking, the bread was very tough to cut and very dense, but it was still quite tasty and full of flavour. These bread flavours arise from fermentation. The high density is possibly attributed to a low water content. Thus, for the subsequent loaves, I went for weighing out the ingredients using a scale instead of the &quot;cups&quot; measurement as a scale is more accurate. </p><p>A few days later, I used the recommended amount of yeast (2 tsp), weighed out the flour (450 g to be exact) and the water. I saw that the dough was still a bit &quot;doughy&quot;, so I added an extra 20 mL of water to the batch (395 mL in total). It was too sticky to be able to knead (Fig 2, img1), yet it felt very soft and after allowing it to rise for several hours, I baked it using the dutch oven. NOTE: I was sure that it had risen well, when the dough (before baking) was very bubbly on the surface and small movements of the bowl containing the dough resulted in a &quot;jiggling&quot; of the dough surface. This time, it rose more than the previous batch (likely due to the extra yeast) and was less dense than the last batch (owing to the excess water added).</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="second batch" src="/assets/images/bread2-19d89ba343b4abe8ec1492f13ad64569.jpeg" width="1280" height="416" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 2.

I wondered what is the impact of leaving the dough to sit for longer? What is the impact of kneading? Surely I can google this, but I wanted to experience the feeling and taste differences. Therefore, the next batch that I made, was using the same contents as above only, I allowed the dough to sit for 3 hours at room temperature, then 2 days in the fridge (covered). The day before cooking, I pulled out the dough, moulded it into a ball and allowed it to sit covered in plastic wrap in the fridge overnight. When I baked this loaf, it rose slightly more than the last batch, and was also more porous (Fig 3). From what I understand, it seems that when you put the dough in the fridge, fermentation is slowed down to allow the development of more complex flavours.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="optimising-a-few-conditions">Optimising a few conditions<a href="#optimising-a-few-conditions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Optimising a few conditions" title="Direct link to Optimising a few conditions">​</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="third batch" src="/assets/images/bread-3-688d4025dcac098afd75278bf7cd9fd2.jpeg" width="1280" height="637" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 3.

Therefore, a dough was prepared as previous, however, it was kneaded for 5 minutes of before allowing the dough to rise. Due to the better properties of the previous batch of bread, the dough was immediately placed in the fridge, in a covered bowel. The dough was left for close to 22 hours in the fridge. The dough appeared to have similar textures as the previous batch, however, was less soft upon touching it.</p><p>The dough was moulded and scored (using tips that I got from <a href="https://vegpatchkitchen.co.uk/what-is-oven-spring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegpatchkitchen</a>) and baked from it&#x27;s cold state. The idea behind scoring is that it allows the gases to uniformly escape, making bread the rise more uniform, instead of having that weird bubble in the middle of the loaf (as seen in img 2 of Fig 3).</p><p>While the final bread loaf in Fig 4 (img 3) appears to be more uniform, without the ugly bubble in the middle, it was less porous than batch 3 (Fig 3). This was attributed to the small additions of flour that I added in order to knead the bread. As small amounts of excess flour decreases the water content, the bread ultimately became more dense. I thought this bread was the tastiest and best looking so far. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="fourth batch" src="/assets/images/bread4-c1294227c25e4d5f5ce68565394cd866.jpeg" width="1280" height="427" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 4.

I allowed it to sit in the fridge while it defrosted. The appearance was no different to when I put it in the freezer, however, it seemed to have less structural integrity (i.e. everytime I tried to mould it into a ball, overtime it would loss the shape).

I popped it in for another half an hour bake, followed by 15 minutes without the lid.</p><p>When I pulled it out of the oven, it had a very large circumference which is consistent with the dough losing its shape. It rose a bit, but was not as inflated as previous. I suspect that some of the yeast died when it was frozen and to compensate for this, I shouldve added extra yeast to the batch.

I attributed the poor shape to yeast dying during the freezing process. This enticed me to use more yeast this time, as I plan to freeze it. </p><p><em>Method</em>
To the yeast, add the warm water and a pinch of sugar. Wait 5-10 minutes for the yeast to foam (I love this part! It&#x27;s like I am controlling my own little world). Add all dry ingredients to a bowl. Mix around and add the water/yeast mixture. Stir through. (Note: the mixture will be very wet. That is great. The more wet or sticky it is, the more porous it will be! Although I&#x27;m not sure how freezing will affect this though) and cover for 3 hours. (Note: I put my dough in the microwave, seems to be a warm spot). </p><p>After 3 hours, I pulled the dough out of the bowl, a lightly covered with flour, being careful not to press it (i.e. knead) too much. Next, I placed it in a bread bag, allowing a little bit of air in and room for the dough to still grow and then put into the freezer where it will sit for a few days. I plan to bake it sometime next week. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1462024-"><em>14.6.2024</em> <br><a href="#1462024-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1462024-" title="Direct link to 1462024-">​</a></h3><p>On Tuesday 11.6.24, I pulled the dough out of the freezer and let it defrost in the fridge for 48 hours.

This post is exhausted with the optimisation of bread, which I did not want to add to as it would get repetitive overtime. But this loaf was a little different. </p><p>On Thursday evening (20/6/24), I started to foam the yeast in warm water, and weigh out all the ingredients, when I found that we had no flour left. I used 300 g of plain flour. Then I scummaged the cupboard for anything that we may have and I found soy and coconut flour. After doing a quick search online, I found that people often add soy flour to their recipe to create softer bread. The highest % of soy flour incorporated was 10%. Therefore, I changed the recipe and used soy flour with plain flour. In my recipe, I used 16% of soy flour.</p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><div align="center"> 300 g plain flour <br> 50 g soy flour <br> 295 g water <br> 2 tsp yeast <br> 1 tsp salt <br> a little flour for working up the dough <br> </div><p><strong>Steps:</strong></p><ol><li>As usual, the yeast was grown in the warm water until it foamed (5 mins). </li><li>Dry ingredients were combined</li><li>Everything was mixed with a wooden spoon.

Unlike the other loaves that I made, this one was very easy to cut through. It was so soft in the mouth and had a different flavour to it. I&#x27;m not sure if the flavour was because there was a lower flour to yeast ratio, or due to the Soy flour, but it was definitely tasty and slightly sweeter than usual. It should also be noted that previous studies with soy flour have indicated that 10% incorporation is best for the texture and flavour of bread. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/bread6-fef781444b4ed95da22d6da3ee6d0fe2.jpeg" width="1280" height="356" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: Bread made with 16% soy flour</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you can see from the images, the crumb of soy flour is slightly browner than previous loaves, with the crust being more golden. Soy bean itself is hydrophillic (water-loving) compared to wheat-flour which is water-hating. In bread recipes using 100% wheat flour, the hydrophobic associations (forms of non-covalent bonds, or interactions between molecules) between the gluten network make the bread quite tough. On the other hand, as soy flour is hydrophillic, it is more effective at absorbing water, which means that by incorporating soy flour into the dough, you will retain a higher level of water during the baking process. The proteins in soy will interact with water, and as the water evaporates, the bonds are less tough and therefore the bread will be softer.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h2><ol><li>Cho, I.H. and D.G.

Now I realise that 15 minutes would have been sufficient as later baking makes it softer. </p><p>After steaming the tempeh, it was marinated with oregano (1 tsp), yogurt (2 tbsp), lemon juice (1 tbsp), salt (1 tsp) and pepper (1/4 tsp). I allowed it to soak up the marinate for 1 hour before I baked the tempeh. Usually, I would let the marinade soak for 3 hours min, however, as the tempeh was hot and the proteins somewhat denatured from the steaming, I thought that 1 hour was sufficient enough to allow the tempeh to absorb the flavour.</p><p>The tempeh was placed in an oven proof dish (trying to conserve the marinate in the dish) and baked for 10 minutes at 220 °C, mixed with the excess marinade and then baked for another 10 minutes. </p><p>The tempeh was then used as a chicken substitue in a wrap, with a homemade tzatzkiki and flatbread. </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHMIEHjhjxs?si=faVa6XkIVwEvP7TV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/my-vegetarian-cookbook">my vegetarian cookbook</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/cooking">cooking</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/tempeh">tempeh</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2024/June/pastry">Puff pastry</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-06-03T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 3, 2024</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="preparation-of-the-pastry">Preparation of the pastry<a href="#preparation-of-the-pastry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Preparation of the pastry" title="Direct link to Preparation of the pastry">​</a></h2><p><em>1.6.24</em><br>
From my <a href="/blog/2024/May/spinach_cheese_triangles">previous post</a>, I prepared puff pastry with flour, butter and water. The puff pastry was then used to make spinach and cheese triangles. They were very nice, but the pastry was very sweet. Therefore, I wanted to create a recipe that was less sweet and more to my tastes. To achieve this, I decreased the amount of butter and added oil and extra salt. </p><p>The ingredients were as follows: </p><div align="center"> 400 g plain flour <br> 1 tsp salt <br> 53 g butter <br> 1 tbsp olive oil <br> 155 g water <br> </div><p><em>Method:</em>
In a large mixing bowl, the flour and salt were combined. Butter was chopped into small squares and using my hands, the flour and butter were rubbed together creating a crumbly flour. Next, the oil was added and the flour/butter mixture and oil were gently rubbed together (now, the texture was more crumbly). Finally, I added 155 g water (Note, I weight out the water, but it would equate to 155 mL). and used my hands to mix. The mixture was crumbly, but good enough to roll out. With floured hands and a lightly floured surface, I rolled the dough out into a long, thin pastry (maybe 0.5 cm thick?). Next I folded it several times onto itself and covered in plastic wrap. The covered dough was placed in the fridge.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pastry2-9f2e8275824cd100584942f5cd58d64f.jpeg" width="1280" height="383" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: From preparing the crumbling dough by rubbing ingredients together, to rolling out the dough and folding it into a plastic wrap</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I think 2 hours is adequate enough to chill the pastry, however, I left it in the fridge until I wanted to use it. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="further-preparation">Further preparation<a href="#further-preparation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Further preparation" title="Direct link to Further preparation">​</a></h2><p><em>2.6.24</em><br>
I pulled the dough out of the fridge and unwrapped it. There were folding marks present, however once I rolled it out with a rolling pin, the dough became smooth again. I tried to roll it out as thin as I could and then cut it into three sections. One filled the inside of a pan, and the other is to act as a pie top (for dinner tomorrow night, see image 1 below). Both were covered and placed in the fridge again. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pastry3-8e28a7de5c3324474ce20bb3bc1581a4.jpeg" width="1280" height="554" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: Preparation of a pie (left) and the cheese triangles after baking (right)</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cheese-trianges">Cheese trianges<a href="#cheese-trianges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cheese trianges" title="Direct link to Cheese trianges">​</a></h3><p>With the third section, I divided it into five small triangles. 1 tsp of filling was placed in the centre of each triangle and then it was folded onto itself several times to make a triangle like shape. The triangles were placed in the oven to bake for 30 minutes.  </p><p>The filling consisted of: </p><div align="center"> 1/4 cup ricotta <br> 1/4 cup crumbled feta <br>  pinch of nutmeg + pepper <br> 1/4 cup tasty cheese<br> sprinkle of bread crumbs <br> 1 egg <br></div><p>I have to say, I enjoyed this pastry! It tasted very savoury, and you could not pick up any sweetness, only from that of the cheese. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spinach-and-ricotta-pie">Spinach and ricotta pie<a href="#spinach-and-ricotta-pie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spinach and ricotta pie" title="Direct link to Spinach and ricotta pie">​</a></h3><p><em>3.6.24</em>

In a frypan, I cooked onion in ~1tbsp of olive oil until it was translucent. Next, the mushrooms were added and fried for about 7 minutes (until brown and sweating), finally I added 2 handfulls of fresh spinach and cooked until wittled. Mixture was cooled for a few minutes.</p><p>The mushroom mixture was added to a bowl filled with ricotta, feta, tasty cheese and egg. The mixture was stirred and then transferred to the baking dish containing the pastry. Next, the second sheet of pastry was placed on top and the edges were joined together using a fork. Holes were marked in the top of the pie using a fork and then the pie was briefly brushed with milk. </p><p>The pie was baked for 40 minutes, and left to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before eating. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pastry-pie-b34656f0b5ba354abaad2636d42be8eb.jpeg" width="476" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img Caption: Tonights dinner, Mushroom &amp; spinach pie.
