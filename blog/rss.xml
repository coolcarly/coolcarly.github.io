            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Through Rainbow Club (A swim club that I used to work for), I was offered tickets to see the Dragons vs. the Raiders at Win Stadium in Wollongong. Tonight, Nick and I caught the train to Wollongong, had a few beers and dinner at the Illawarra Brewing Co. and then headed to the stadium to watch the game.
<img loading="lazy" alt="A selfie before the game starts" src="/assets/images/football-raiders-dragons-cf88e60798a756638dc76de954fd3d5a.png" width="3088" height="2316" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Our seats were not the best. The whole first half of the game, the ball was down the opposite end of the field (as Raiders had majority possession). I was excited for the second half, thinking that Raiders would be mostly down our end. HOwever, during the second half, Dragons had majority possession and scored at least 4 tries to make it almost even. </p><p>A few other families from Rainbow Club attended the match too. I got to catch up with them, which was really nice. I do miss the people at Rainbow Club. It's just a shame that I do not enjoy teaching anymore. THe thought of spending 3 hours in the cold, chlorinated pool does not make me feel good.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Standard Monday workday. I feel too tired to go to the lab. I decided to work from home. All day, I have not done any thesis writing for my PhD , only updating my blog. I feel very nervous to go into the lab tomorrow. My supervisors want me to go to NZLD to do some lab work. After my trip to <a href="/life/trips/usa">USA 2023</a>, I don't want to go anywhere for the rest of the year. It is too windy to do any outside activities but I am feeling stressed from my lack of water time - swimming or paddling.</p>]]></content:encoded>
