processing of critical minerals, uranium and ores containing radioactivity - leaching, solvent extraction, ion exchange and precipitation techniques.

Minerals and metals are mined from the earth. The rock/sediment in which they are mined is termed an **ore**. Ore is treated chemically to convert the salts into a soluble form that can be extracted from the rock. This solvent extraction is termed **hydrometallurgy.** Hydrometallurgy relies on **leaching**

The common types of leaching include
1. Cyanide: often used for extraction of gold
2. Ammonia: Used for a wide range of extractions, such as Nickel and cobalt ([Hu et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213343722018097)), copper ([Radmehr et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40033-013-0029-x)).
3. Alkali leaching: eg. iron and aluminium from bauxite ([Manish et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4605/15/1/42))
4. Acid leaching


Other metals can be extracted from the ore using solvent/solution based methods.

High concentrations of dissolved minerals, including calcium, magnesium, cause water to become 'hard'. Ion exchanges are used to convert one mineral to another. Ion exchange resins are often used to exchange higher purity minerals.
