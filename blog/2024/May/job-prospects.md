Received correspondance from Nikia from Evolve Scientific asking about my background. We spoke on the phone for 10 minutes and then I sent through a cover letter for a potential job with ANSTO.

Received correspondance from Christine Anthony asking for a screening with Alnex via MS Teams on Wed 8 May 2024
## About
üìç Botany, NSW, AU <br/>
Allnex specialises in coatings, resins, crosslinkers and additives. 
In the job advertisement, they mentioned the sustainability of coatings moving forward. 
With my research, I saw that coating based chemists get paid $70,000 per year. I don't think I will settle for this amount if the job is not worth it.  

Polymer resins are highly viscous, semi-solid compound that can be polymerised to produce hard plastics. They often comprise of composite blends. Examples of polymer resins include: Epoxy resin, polyurethane, silicone, polyester. 

Some industrial examples include: 
- Acrylic resins (eg. artificial nails), UV-cured printing inks, lacquers, paints, varnishes, and glues. 
- Alkyd resins (derived from animal fats): often used in paints. Alkyd emulsions reduce the organic solvent content in paint and have potential to remove the need for organic solvent.([Hofland](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300944011000324#fig0030))
- oxazolines

Received correspondance from Nikita from Evolve Scientific Recruitment: ANSTO would like to meet with me on Friday at 10 am via MS Teams, for a potential Research Chemist role. I asked what the interview will be like and she replied "It will be quite casual. Some technical questions but more to get to know if you would be a good fit before an onsite interview." The next day, Nikita emailed to inform me that the interview was cancelled and instead they would like to meet face-to-face. 

## About the job
#### Responsibilities include:
- Planning and implementing experiments that involve processing of critical minerals, uranium and ores containing radioactivity - leaching, solvent extraction, ion exchange and precipitation techniques.
- Analyse and assess data, recognise the value of data and identify gaps that need to be filled in order to draw conclusions and develop process solutions.
- Writing reports and contributing to journal and conference publications relating to the research project.
- Assist in the preparation and presentation of papers for national and international forums.

#### Skills & experience:
- PhD qualifications in Chemical Engineering, Applied Chemistry, Chemistry or Metallurgy
- Australian Citizenship required
- Research experience in Applied Chemistry or Hydrometallurgy
- Experience with leaching of minerals, separation science such as solvent extraction, ion exchange,  crystallisation, membrane separation or water treatment would be an advantage

Examples of seperations: organic/water extractions; chromatography; crystallisation; dialysis; 

- Excellent verbal and written communication skills ‚Äì previous publication in journals

I believe that I have great verbal communication skills: I like telling research stories and presenting. 
I have published one first author article. It was mostly a review. I have prepared other manuscripts; however, they have been sitting in my supervisors inbox for a while. 

- Ability to present at professional forums



#### Job research
According to glassdoor, many people feel dissatisfied with ANSTO, with very little career growth. I am okay with that, because I will be keen to move on after 2 years. 

The minerals team works with uranium, rare earth and lithium processing. 


Some interview questions: 

**"Tell me about youself."**

**"What are your greatest strengths?"**
I am very persistent and have a desire to solve problems as soon as they come up. For example, during writing up my PhD dissertation, I felt that the discussion was lacking some arguments. Therefore, I spent 2 weeks working hard to fit the electrochemical circuits to really understand what was going on. 

Another non-working example, in 2021, I joined the surfclub. I had no surf or paddle experience. However, for 1 hour every morning, I would practice and practice. In 2023, I won the Illawarra Branch surf swim and am regarded highly for my skills as a paddler.


**"What is one of your weaknessess?"**
I think one of my big weaknesses in a laboratory setting is that I have so many ideas that I want to persue. In the past, this has lead to me jumping straight into the idea without careful planning. I have been working on this by keeping an "ideas notebook." Here, I put down all the ideas that I have. As I read and plan out my work, sometimes it turned out that it was a bad idea. 

**‚ÄúWhy do you want to work for this company?‚Äù**
As a polymer chemist, I would love to work in an industry dedicated to making sustainable and viable products. As I have been in the reserach space for a number of years, I would like the opportunity to explore my talents in industry. Allnex was one of the first companies that appeared in my job searches. I saw that Allnex specialise in coatings and resins and it
**‚ÄúWhy do you believe you are the best candidate for this position?‚Äù

**"why do you want the job?"**
I have been interested in working at ANSTO since my undergraduate degree. In fact, I applied to work here several years ago.. only to realise that the job that i was going for was more of a lab tech role. I love research and love learning and would love to do something that makes an impact on the science industry. 

**‚ÄúWhat attracted you to apply for this role?‚Äù**
First, I love chemistry and I am keen to learn more in this area. During my PhD candidature, I felt very isolated. I had so many questions and I gained so much knowledge that I would have loved to pass on. Yet, there was noone around help (aside from my supervisors). I look forward to startinbg fresh in a research project and harnessing the skills that I gained from my PhD. I have several contacts that work at ANSTO, or have worked here and they have a wide variety of skills and are making an incredible impact into the science space. This is what I would like to do.
