In order to prepare a sourdough starter, I needed 1 week where I wasn't going to be away from home. After the [Mudgee](./mudge-24.md) weekend, I decided that this week would be a perfect opportunity to get the starter up and running. What do I mean by a sourdough starter? I mean to grow the bacteria necessary to craft sourdough bread. 

I started with the following equipment/ingredients: 
- Rye flour*
- tap water**
- 2 x 500 g jars
- food scale

Note: I chose rye flour as the starting flour because it is meant to have a higher level of good bacteria. 
Note: Some say that you should use bottled water for the initial week (because chlorine is not present). I filled a drink bottle and left it overnight. By doing this, the chlorine dissapates from the water. You could also use boiled water (cooled down of course).

The ideal environment is 24–28 °C. As it is winter, sometimes I used warmer water (30°C) and wrapped it in a towel to warm it up. 

Here I have listed the method that I used to create my sourdough starter. It is still young at the moment and I have not yet baked bread with it.

## *Day 1, Friday 14 June 2024*
First, I weighed out my jar. Next, I measured 20 g of rye flour and 30 g of water and combined. The mixture was as viscous as a "thick pancake batter." The jar was covered with a breathable lid (in my case, paper towl) and left to sit at room temperature for 24 hours. Note here that the temperature will determine the speed at which the bacteria will grow. At the moment, it is winter so the temperatures will be max 20 °C. 

## *Day 2, Saturday 15 June 2024*
I repeated the process. I added 20 g of rye flour and 30 g of water, mixed to combine so it appeared as a "thick pancake batter", covered and let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours. 

## *Day 3, Sunday 16 June 2024*
I repeated the process: 20 g of rye flour and 30 g of water, mixed to combine so it appeared as a "thick pancake batter", covered and let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours. At this stage, the starter was beginning to smell very sour, almost like our food bin/compost bin. 

## *Day 4 Monday 17 June 2024*
When I lifted the paper towel from the container, I observed small bubbles which is indicative of gases forming and thus carbon dioxide. I emptied half of the contents into a new container and discarded the rest. Then I repeated the process from yesterday: 20 g of rye flour and 25 g of water. Note: I used less water this time, because that was enough to form a thick paste with consistency similar to yesterday. I made note of the temperature of the room, which was 18.5 °C. 

After covering the glass jar, again with a breathable cover - in this case paper towel, I then put a rubber band around the jar to mark the level of the yeast. This time, I left it to sit for 14 hours at room temperature. 

## *Day 5 Tuesday 18 June 2024*
At 6 am (when I woke up), I opened the jar and I could see that the bubbles were slightly larger than yesterday. The flour mixture was increasing it's sour odour. I stirred the flour mixture and allowed it to sit until I returned home from work. 

At 4.30 pm, I opened the jar ready to feed it. I could not really make out a difference from yesterday. I scooped half of the mixture out (47 g to be exact) and put it in a fresh container. For some reason, I added the 20 g flour and 30 g water to the old container. I guess I was in autopilot mode. Nontheless, I mixed it and then covered again. I observed that some bubbles began to form once I left it for a few hours. 

## *Day 6 Wednesday 19 June 2024*
I checked the sourdough again this morning. The temperature was 16.7 °C. There were no bubbles present. I gave it a stir once again and left it to sit for the rest of the day. 

It is unusual that there was no activity. There could be many reasons for this. Perhaps that the temperature is so cold. Therefore, I wrapped the container in a tea towel to assist in warming up the jar. 

At the usual time of 4.30 pm, I halved the starter (31 g) and fed the starter more flour (30 g) and water (53 g). 


## *Day 7 Thursday 20 June 2024*
The starter appeared to grow slightly when I checked it this morning. As the last few days, I gave it a stir and added a little bit of water (10 g). In the afternoon, I halved the mixture (33 g starter) and fed it with 30 g rye flour and 54 g of water.

## *Day 8 Friday 21 June 2024*
At this point, I was convinced that the yeast was alive. Just before I was going to feed the starter, I did a "float test" of the dough to show that gases were present. In a float test, a small amount of starter is placed into water and if it floats, it means that it the starter is active (but does not necessarily mean that it is ready). 

Now, I decided to increase the feed content of the starter. I took 22 g of the starter and fed it with 40 g of flour and 99 g of water. 

## *Day 9 Saturday 22 June 2024*
Again, when I checked the sourdough starter (at 4 pm), it was very foamy but did not appear to rise. 

I weighed 22 g of the mixture into a fresh jar and fed it with 45 g of rye flour and 75 g water. While we were out during the day, I placed the starter into the warm-ish oven (it was no hotter than 30 degrees). When I returned home, the starter was more bubbly than before. 

## *Day 10 Sunday 23 June 2024*
When I checked the starter at 8 am, I saw that the starter grew almost to double it's size. I suspect that 4 hours in a 30 degree oven helped the bacteria to grow. How exciting! By 4 pm, the starter appeared more active and grew a little more. 

In a fresh jar, I weighed 20 g of starter, added 40 g of rye flour and 84 g water. With the left over discard, I made banana pancakes ! They were very tasty and fluffy too. 

## *Day 11 Monday 24 June 2024*
I checked the starter at 6 am and I saw that the starter grew slightly but it seemed to collapse by 4 pm. It looks like it is ready to bake. I just need to get my timing right. Once again, in a fresh jarr, I weighed 16 g of starter, 47 g flour and 99 g water. It was more watery than usual (I wanted to know if it wasn't rising because of the water content). The discard was placed in a fresh container and left in the fridge for 2 days (I made pastry with it later on).

## *Day 12 Tuesday 25 June 2024*
In the morning, it appeared to rise (not double it's size, but by 50%), but once again by 4 pm - it shrunk. 

I repeated the procedure. I weighed 16 g of starter in a fresh jar, and fed it with 50 g of flour and 82 g of water. With this discard, I made [pancakes](./sourdough-pancakes.md).

## *Day 13 Wednesday 26 June 2024*
By 8 am, it grew as per yesterday. This time, I wanted to see if feeding it would sustain the yeast for a little longer. Therefore, at 8 am, I added 13 g of flour and 17 g of water. Over the day, it grew but not a lot. At 8 pm, I watched the starter and it looked like it was breathing with gas bubbles popping occasionally. I left the sourdough starter to sit overnight. 

## *Day 14 Wednesday 27 June 2024*
At 6 am, I saw that the sourdough starter had deflated since last night. There's no wonder considering that I did not feed it yesterday. As usual, I weighed out 22 g of starter and fed it with 40 g of flour and 64 g of water. The reason for using more starter this time, is that I am worried that the yeast is not strong enough yet. 

........... this will continue.

## Outlook:
- Since Day 1, the temperature has been average of 18.2 ± 1.2, with some days the dough being placed in a warmish area than room temperature. I believe that temperature has a large role in the activity of the yeast as in colder environments, it takes longer to grow. 

<!-- Things to note: 
Your starter is healthy and vigorous — in other words, good for baking — when it doubles in size within 6 to 8 hours. A helpful blog post: [here](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2020/06/10/10-tips-for-new-sourdough-bakers#I-read) -->
