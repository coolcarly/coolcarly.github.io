What can we do with sourdough discard? I would hate to waste my sourdough discards, which is why I have been searching for different things to do with it. Did you know that discard lasts for a few days in the fridge? This recipe uses a 2 day old discard.

So today, I wanted to make some pastry with it. Beforehand, I did a quick search and found that pastry follows the same method as a regular pastry recipe, only that it uses less flour. I used my previously developed Pastry recipe as follows: 

Makes 2 sheets of pastry

**Ingredients:** <br/>
225 g flour <br/>
25 g butter<br/>
1 tbsp olive oil<br/>
1/2 tsp salt<br/>
1/2 tsp garlic powder<br/>
50-100 g of sourdough starter*<br/>

**Method (pastry):** 
1. The butter was cut into small cubes (0.5 cmx0.5cm) 
2. The butter and flour was rubbed together to make a crumbled flour
3. The oil was added and mixed in, then the flour was rubbed further
4. salts were mixed in
5. Starter was mixed in. 
6. A small amount of water was added (just to make it come together)
7. Stretch and fold of the pastry several times
8. Moulded the pastry into a Dish, covered and placed in the fridge overnight.*

**Filling:**
1/2 brown onion <br/> 
1 garlic cloves<br/>
1/4 cup cream<br/>
60 g ricotta<br/>
1/3 cup tasty cheese<br/>
200 g button mushrooms, sliced<br/>
2 handfulls of spinach<br/>
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper

9. Over medium heat, melt butter and fry onion and garlic until onion is translucent. 
10. Add mushrooms and fry until they start to sweat. 
11. Add spinach.
12. In a seperate bowl, combine the cheese and cream. Add the mushroom mixture and salt and pepper. 
13. Pour mixture into the dish (pre-moulded with pastry)
14. Cover the top with the second layer of pastry. 
15. Bake at 200 Â°C (fan forced) for 30 minutes.

**Notes about this recipe:**
Note about the starter: This was a discard that I kept in the fridge for 2 days. I think it is safe to leave sourdough discard for 3 days in the fridge, so I wanted to use it before I needed to throw it away. 

NOTE about the hydration: on the 26.06.24: before I added the starter, I added 1/2 cup of water (which I realised was a mistake therefore this recipe is tweaked). After I added the starter, it was very sticky! This was wrong, the consistency should be crumbly. Therefore, it is crucial to add the sourdough starter before extra water, so you correct the consistency. 

Note for step 8: Refrigeration is important for pastry. The colder it is, the better. You want the butter and oil to solidify to bring the crumbly consistency to your pastry. I also think that it will aid in bring flavours out of the sourdough.
