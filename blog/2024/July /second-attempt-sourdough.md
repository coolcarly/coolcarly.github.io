On day 22 of my [sourdough starter](../June/sourdough-starter.md), I fed the starter at 8 am. At 3 pm, I used the majority of the starter (81 g) to prepare another loaf of sourdough. 

**Ingredients:**
601 g flour <br/>
320 g water <br/>
1.5 tsp salt <br/>
81 g starter <br/>

**Methods:**
1. Combine flour, salt and starter. 
2. Slowly add the water (ensure that it is not very sticky, should be flaky).
3. Cover and let sit for 2 h hour at room temperature. 
4. Perform 8 x stretch and folds of the dough.* 
5. Let it sit, covered for 30 minutes.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5, 2 more times.**
7. Let it sit covered at room temperature for 4 hours. 
8. Placed dough on surface. Performed several shape and pulls***
9. placed in a clean bowl, covered and refrigerated for 35 hours. 
10. Pull out of the fridge. Shape again and allow to proof on baking paper, covered with a towl for 1 hour (while the dutch oven preheats).
11. Bake at 220 °C for 30 minutes in the dutch oven with the lid on and 10 minutes with the lid off. 
12. Let it sit for 30 minutes before cutting into it. 

**Notes:** <br/>
*In the container, grab the dough from one side and stretch it out, fold over. Turn the bowl by 90° and repeat. 

** With increasing time and cycles, the dough should be getting stickier, less flaky and harder to pull. The dough should also be reforming it's shape.  

***Cup the dough with your hands. Using the bench for friction, pull the dough towards you. If the dough is too sticky, lubricate the bench with a small amount of water or flour.
