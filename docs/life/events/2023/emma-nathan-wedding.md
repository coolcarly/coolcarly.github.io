On Friday 15 September 2023, Nathan and Emma got married on a nice estate in Camden. Bride's maid duties meant that I was staying on the property overnight to assist with morning bride duties. Therefore, on Thursday morning 14 September 2023, I woke up at 4.30 am so I could get in a morning paddle before I headed to mum's house by bus. When I arrived at Glenfield station, mum picked me up and we went and got a mani-pedi and ate breakfast. Afterwards, we went to help Emma set up the venue. 

The house that we stayed in was amazing - it was old with vents in the floor. When you walked into the house, there was a long isle, with several rooms attached. The light switches literally hung from the roof and you pulled the string to turn the light on. I shared a room/bed with Nicole and it was pretty comfy king sized bed. But given that the hosue was an old but maintained house, it was very cold and also very creaky. The house made many noises at night, which was kind of freaky. 

The morning of the wedding was very tiring. We woke at 8 am, had a bite to eat and then started with hair and makeup while drinking mimosas. Emma went for the Hollywood hairstyle for us bridesmaids. Once we were finished with hair and makeup, we hung around for a bit before the photographer came. We didn't do many photos just the typical bridal pics. 

By 2 pm, we were ready to walk down the aisle. Wow. How scary was that! I was so nervous and trying so hard not to cry. 

The ceremony was in a nice garden but with full sun. I was sweating a lot! They did some cool things, like the wedding wrap on the hands - which is a thing from the vikings era. Emma even walked down the aisle to a song from the Lord of the Rings. It was quite funny. 

During cocktail hour, I got to spend some time with Nick before we headed off for photos. The photos were really cool and funny. For example, in some of them, I got to sit in the front seat of the wedding car and pretend to drive.
