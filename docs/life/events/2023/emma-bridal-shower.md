##### 3.6.23
At 12.30 pm Saturday 3 June 2023, Emma had her Bridal Lunch/Bridal Shower/Kitchen Tea/Bitchin' Tea. Emma isn't a material girl, and wasn't so keen to have a bridal shower initially. However, my mum persuaded her to have one at Mum's house. It turned out to be a great day. My aunty Cheryl prepared a wonderful grazing table and flower displays. My mum set up the back awning and it looked so amazing. 

Some things were a bit strange. For instance, the cake was black and red. No-one had any cake because the black dye stained teeth (and clothing). I am the cake eater in every occasion, I remove all the waste. But today, I did not go anywhere near it, as I did not want to ruin my clothes.*Note:* Never order a cake that is dyed black. 

Each of us bridesmaids prepared a game for the event. My game was called "cold feet." I painted on all the stones - they each had a number and the number corresponded to the envelope. In each envelope there was a note (I wrote some funny ones) and prize. The major prize was a $20 gift certificate to Woolworths. The others were either Condoms, lollypops or lollies. 

The aim of the game was to pick up a stone from freezing cold water with your foot. The number you picked, was the prize that you won. Unfortunately, I didn't plan it very well. The stones were so glossy that as soon as I placed them in the icey water, the paint fell off. I had to completely change the game to be: a 30 sec race to pick up as many stones as possible. 

I was the winner of the game, but I gave my prize to the person that came 2nd: Amy. Other games were facilitated by the other bridesmaids such as: 
- Dirty minds (by Olivia): Where there is a dirty pun line and you have to think of what it could be referring to. 
- What did he say (by Nicole): where Emma has to guess how Nathan answered the question to a variety of events that have occured in their relationship (eg when did they first do the deed). 
- True or False (By Lisa): Where everyone either guesses true or false to something that Emma has done in her life. This was hilarious, because Emma has done a lot of things (eg. eat something from the compost bin as a dare).
The bridal lunch finished around 4.30 pm. It was a fun day, and I think that Emma was very happy with how great it was. I made a little snippet video of the Bridal Shower:
