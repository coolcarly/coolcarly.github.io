### 2023-07-16
Unfortunately, my time in the mountains is very limited these days. I do miss trail running and exploring out in the bush, but I struggle to find the time lately to go. Since most national parks do not allow dogs, it is difficult to convince Nick to go hiking on the weekend. At some point, I will find the time to go by myself. 

As I reminisce on previous trips, I want to share a very well documented trip that I took back in 2022. 

### 3-5 Jan 2022
Dani messages me on Sunday and says "hey lets go for a 3-day hike tomorrow." I say "okay, lets do it."
