# Welcome to my basic life
### About
Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are a lie. People only post their best-selves on there. For a long time, I believed that everyone was doing cooler things and I wanted to be anywhere else but here. I mean this quite literally - I was never happy with where I was on any given day, or with my life in general. After taking a step back from social media, I am starting to learn to stop comparing myself to others and only do what makes me happy. 

To this day, I still have my social media accounts, but I refuse to upload photos or spend too long scrolling through the newsfeed. Nowadays, I use it as an "advertising tool", to try and persuade people to watch my silly videos or read my blog. When I say people, I mean my family and close friends.

In this post, I will try to upload photos of my basic life. Sometimes they are boring and sometimes they are fun - because that is life - it is not always fun. Do be warned though, I live in the best place on Earth (Wollongong), so it may spark some jealousy.
