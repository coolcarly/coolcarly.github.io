# End of season note
I am so happy to be a member of NWSLSC. It has really lifted my spirits, even when times are hard. The community vibe that I get from the club is something that I haven't had in my life and something I want to keep in my life for as long as possible. Since moving here, I felt that I was given so much: just being able to come to the club and grab a board and catch some waves is so amazing. Thats why I was happy to step into Alieshas role as the social organiser, even though this is only my second season in surf lifesaving! I wanted to give back to the community. 

Yet, it's hard to join the committee when I feel that I have very limited experience about the surf club life. I am trying my best to get up to date and it helps to have amazing people on the committee and throughout the club who can educate me and share their knowledge and wisdom. This year alone I have learned a hell of a lot from everyone at the club and improved my skills tremendously. 

Owing to the surf-club construction and the UCI event, the first social event of the season was quite late: In November, *the sunset socials.* This was a great afternoon and I would like to thank everyone who came. I met a few people and caught up with others that I had met last season (2021-2022). Next season (2023-2024), I would like to try and organise this same event on the weekend before patrols begin - hopefully the sea-wall will be ready by then. 

The second social event for 2022 was the Christmas Party at Wisemans park bowling club. This was so much fun and I really appreciate the numbers that came to make it such a great day. I got my competitive nature on in bowls and managed to win a few games!

I had other thoughts about social activities this season, such as a social swim and paddle but it didn't pan out due to bad weather. For next season, I will set up a schedule, where once a month we will do a surf club Bronze and SRCs swim/paddle  - maybe around 7-8 am. It can be competitive and it can also be for fun. You will get points for showing up and points for placing 1-3. It will be a fun "point-score". Prizes will be awarded at the end of season (TBA). On the days that the weather/surf is bad, a sand event will be held instead: such as a 2 km run or beach flags. I will plan to make a roster by the end of August. 

Until then, I will keep training to improve my surf skills, surf- swimming and paddling so that next year I can compete at different carnivals.
