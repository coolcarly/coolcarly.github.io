# Patrolling days
At NWSLSC, we have 6 patrolling groups. In each group, there are about 10 people with various levels of experience: some have their Bronze medallion, some have just First Aid and are in training for their bronze. Others have the Bronze medallion plus other awards, such as IRB crew, IRB driver, advanced rescusitation. There is also an assigned Patrol captain and vice-captain. 

Volunteer surf lifesavers patrol every Sunday and public holiday. At our club, we are on an alternating roster. Sometimes we patrol once a month, while othertimes it is weekly (over easter period, christmas etc). 

I joined the club in September 2022, where I did my bronze with NWSLSC. It seems like I've been doing it forever.
