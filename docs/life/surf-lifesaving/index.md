I am a #patrolling member of North Wollongong Surf Lifesaving Club (NWSLSC) where I do a lot of cool stuff and participate in a lot of water sports: swimming, paddling, rowing and soon to be surf skiing. Here are some things that I've learned during my time with surf lifesaving, more to be added when I feel like it:

- [Introduction to SLSA](./my-introduction.md)
- [Bluebottles](./bluebottles.md)
- [PCYC community program & NWSLSC](./pcyc-community-program.md)
- [Patrol days](./patrol-days.md)
- [End of season note](./end-of-season-note2.md)

In the off season, I have joined the [Floating Flamingo's Swim Club](/life/swimming-and-surfing/floating-flammingos)
