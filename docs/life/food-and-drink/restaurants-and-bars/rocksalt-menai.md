On Saturday 14 October, 2023, Nick and I went out for dinner to Rock Salt in Menai. It is a lovely restaurant, and a little classy with a similar vibe to Jensens. They allow a BYO wine; however, charge $5 per person for "corkage". We took our last Shiraz from Lucy's run that we purchased in the [Hunter Valley](/docs/life/trips/hunter-valley.md). 

We arrived about 15 minutes early to our 7.15 pm reservation; yet, we were immediately seated and within 10 minutes we had ordered and our entrée's were served. For me, I ordered the Bao buns while Nick ordered fish. It was very nice, but it was very sticky. I didn't think about the fact that I had to use my hands to eat. Therefore, in between the entrée and main, I had to wash my hands. 

For my main meal, I ordered the pumpkin and goats cheese ravioli, while Nick ordered the Pork. This Ravioli was amazing, and also Nick commented on how great his was.

After dinner, we split a banana pudding. It was soooo delicious and on the same level as the Jensens pudding. Also, Nick had mentioned to them that it was our anniversary (it wasn't but we didn't celebrate our anniversary); so the waiters brought out a free cake that had "Happy anniversary" written on the plate. It was super cute! Apologies for not taking a photo!! 

Between [Jensens](./jensens.md) and this restaurant, I  like Jensens a bit more. The food is a lot nicer and the flavours are so amazing compared to RockSalt. That's not to say that Rock Salt wasn't great, because it was very nice!
