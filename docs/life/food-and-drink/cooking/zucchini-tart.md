### 19.3.23 
This recipe was adapted from [Cheese & onion tart](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/cheese-caramelised-onion-tart)

I tried to follow this recipe but I think I have some form of dyslexia causing me to misread the instructions.... Although I am close to a PhD in chemistry, so it musn't be that bad (although I did struggle a lot in following the instructions during undergrad chem labs). I guess they organised the instructions really weird and I found it difficult to follow. I'm not sure who can relate to this problem I have, I know Nick can't because he can follow recipes really well - I guess he remains more focused than me.  

In this recipe, I used zucchini because on our weekly grocery shop, Nick and I bought two massive zucchinis (probably the size of 4 medium zucchinis) for $1. They were a part of the "odd bunch" and possibly going to be thrown away in a few days. I put them in the trolley and said I would think of things to use them for. I think it went really well with this recipe. Another that I will try this week is a halloumi bake that incorporates zucchini, adapted from [here](https://www.tamingtwins.com/grilled-halloumi-cheese-bake-recipe/).

*Img caption:* Zucchini tart.

*Ingredients list:* 1 large zucchini diced, 1 onion diced, 40 g butter, 100g flour, 3 eggs (2 for zucchini mixture, 1 for the base), 1 sliced tomato, 1/4 cup of cheese, salt. 

This is how I did it: 

**To prepare the base:**
1. Add 40 g of butter to 100 g of flour and crumble it together untill the butter is rubbed in. 
2. Add 1 beaten egg and mix together. 
3. Set out on a floured bench and role out
4. Add to a greased tart pan or any random dish and make sure it covers and hangs over the sides. I used a bit of water to help it slide, and pushed it with my fingers to cover the pan. 
5. Use a folk to punch holes all over, put in fridge for 20 min. 
6. Bake for 30 mins at 180 Â°C or until crispy - I picked some crust off the side to taste. 

**To prepare the zucchini mixture:**
1. Fry diced onions in an oiled pan until they are "caramelised". 
2. Add the diced zucchini and extra oil and cook for 5-7 min. Then sprinkle some salt over the top to maranate.  
3. Add 150 g cream and bring to simmer, then turn off heat. 
4. Add 2 x egg yolks. Mix
5. Spoon the mixture into the baked crust.
6. Top with tomatos
7. Bake for 40 mins or until the mixture is cooked. (i.e. the mixture is bouncy?)
8. sprinkle some tasty cheese and mozzarella on top and then bake for another 20 min. 
9. remove from oven and allow to sit for 10 mins before serving.
