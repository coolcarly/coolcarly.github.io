### 3.5.23
This is a simple one. Adapted from [Australian Mushrooms](https://australianmushrooms.com.au/recipe/mushroom-macaroni-cheese/) and 
[Nora_cooks_vegan](https://www.noracooks.com/category/meal-type/main-dish/) 

I didn't follow the specific recipes because I didn't have some of the ingredients in the first one, and I didn't like the look of the second one. 

*Note:* This could be followed for a vegan alternative. All you have to do is substitute milk for water and cheese for nutritional yeast. 

**In your ingredients list:** 
- Macaroni Pasta (300 g / half a bag)
- 1 garlic clove, Bag of mushrooms (500 g, cut into quarters), bag of spinach (200 g).
- Butter (40 g) & Oil (1 TBS)
- 1/2 Onion, diced; tumeric powder (1/2 tsp), mustard (1 tsp), flour (3 TBSP), lemon juice (1 tsp). 
- Milk (any; 2.5 cups)
- Tasty cheese (1/2 cup); Parmesan cheese (1/4 cup) (any cheese you have will work though). 

**Method:**
1. Cook pasta following packet instructions.
2. In a large fry pan, melt 20g butter, add garlic and mushrooms and cook until they are watering. Add spinach + oil and cook until spinach is wilted. Set the mixture aside in a bowl. 
3. To the same fry pan, add 40 g butter and melt, add onion and cook for 2 mins. 
4. Add flour, tumeric, lemon juice and mustard and stir to combine. 
5. Add milk (1/2 cup at a time) with gentle stirring
6. once all the milk is added, continue stirring until thick (5-10 mins)
7. Remove from heat, add cheeses
8. Add mushroom mixture and pasta. Thoroughly combine. Add a little more lemon juice ontop.
9. Sprinkle breadcrumbs on top and then grill (Careful not to burn it!)
(I would not suggest the breadcrumbs. It ruined a perfectly good macaroni - in my opinion. I will not use it next time.)

### 5.7.23
My mac and cheese was significantly improved this time! 

**Method:**
1. Cook pasta following packet instructions.
2. In a sauce pan, combine 3 tbsp of plain flour, garlic, onion, 1/2 tsp cumin and 2 tbsp of olive oil. 
3. Over the course of 10 mins, slowly add 1-2 cups of milk (I used full-cream, but almond or soy could be used for a vegan alternative). 
4. After the mixture thickens, add 1/3 cup of tasty cheese/cheddar, 1/4 cup of parmasan and 1/4 cup of mozzarella. 
5. Mix until thick and set aside, covered. 
6. In a large fry pan, melt 20g butter, add garlic and mushrooms and cook until they are watering. Add spinach + oil and cook until spinach is wilted. Set the mixture aside in a bowl. 
7. Add the contents of the fry pan to the sauce and mix well to combine. 
8. Add 1 tsp of black pepper and a sprinkle of salt. 
9. Add pasta to sauce and thoroughly combine.
