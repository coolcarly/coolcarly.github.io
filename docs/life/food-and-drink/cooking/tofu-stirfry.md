### About
I have made many tofu stir fries. The general method is to marinate the tofu and allow absorb from 1 hour to a few days. Then fry it in a wok for 10-15 mins so that it is crispy. After, you just add vegetables that you desire, fry for a bit and then serve with rice or noodles. 

I always buy firm tofu because it is more stable and a lot nicer to eat. You also don't need to drain the water from it as you would with softer tofu. Just pat it down with paper towel and then you're ready to go. 

**How to cook?** Fry in a wok with max heat. The hotter the better!
