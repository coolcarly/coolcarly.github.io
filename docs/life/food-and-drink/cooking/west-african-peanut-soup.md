This one is a goodie. It is very filling!! You can serve it with rice or with bread or even naan. 

I adapted my recipe from [Cookie and Kate](https://cookieandkate.com/west-african-peanut-soup/)

Notes:
- You can add any vegetable you like and want to get rid of. Here, I used sweet potato. But previously I have used spinach. 
- Instead of vegetable broth, I use Stock. 
- While red onion is preferred, I didn't have any in the cupboard, so I used brown onion instead. 
- Servings: 4 

#### Ingredients
Soup component: 4 cups of stock/broth or 1 tsp vegetable stock powder; 4 garlics, crushed; 1 brown onion, diced; 1 sweet potato any size, diced; 1 tsp salt; 2 tsp crushed ginger. 
Peanut mixture: 1/2 cup tomato paste, 2/3 cup peanut butter

#### Method
1. To a pot of boiling water (6 cups), add 1 tsp of vegetable stock powder. Add garlic, onion, ginger, sweet potato and salt. 
2. Reduce the heat and cook for 20 minutes.
3. In a medium-sized, heat-safe mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter (2/3 cup),tomato paste (1/2 cup), then transfer 1 to 2 cups of the hot stock to the bowl. Whisk the mixture together until smooth, then pour the peanut mixture back into the soup and mix well. 
4. Simmer until the consistency is as desired (usually 15-20 mins). 2 mins before finish, add spinach (if you are using spinach). 
5. Serve with rice, bread or naan. (I personally like using fresh bread)
