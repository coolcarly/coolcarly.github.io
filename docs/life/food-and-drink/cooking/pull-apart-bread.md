I was really in the mood to bake today. With my love for bread, I decided that a creative, flavoured bread would be appropriate. 
The bread was inspired by [Sally's baking addition](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/rosemary-garlic-pull-apart-bread/). 

## Ingredients
- 2 and 1/3 cups of flour
- 3/4 cups of milk
- 1 tsp sugar
- 2 tsp yeast
- 1 tsp rosemary (dried)
- 1 tsp garlic (dried)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp oil (any) 
- 1 cup mozzarella

## Method
1. In a medium size bowl, combine sugar and yeast. Then add luke-warm milk (about 45 degrees). Leave this for 5-10 minutes until the yeast has formed a biofilm (or is very fluffy). 
2. Once yeast has risen, add all dry ingredients and mix until just combined (I used my hands for this). Then on a lightly floured surface, need for 2-3 minutes and then put into a clean, oiled bowl and cover. Leave to rise overnight. (Note: I put my dough in the microwave to store overnight, so it's out of the way and cannot be contaminated. Some people use the oven.)
3. When you're ready to make the bread, on a lightly floured surface, punch the dough and then kneed slightly. Seperate dough into 12 even pieces. 
4. Using your hands, turn the balls of dough into flat circles (I used a cup to compress it). 
5. Add the cheese ontop of the dough and then fold. 
6. Line each of the semi-circular dough's (that are stuffed with cheese) in a baking pan, semi-circle side up and bake for 50 minutes.
