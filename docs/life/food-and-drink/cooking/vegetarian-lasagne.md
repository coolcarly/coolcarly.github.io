Usually I use whatever vegetables that are in the fridge. Most of the time I use a combination of either Capsicum, mushroom, zucchini, spinach, sweet potato or pumpkin. Sometimes I've put regular potato in there?

 **Red sauce:** 
- 200 g mushroom diced
- 1 onion diced
- 1 zucchini diced
- 1 capsicum diced
- 100 g spinach
- Can tomatos

**Cream sauce** 
- Ricotta (small tub)
- dash of cream
- sprinkle of tasty and parmesan cheese

First, fry the onion in olive oil, then the capsicum, then zucchini, then mushroom, then spinach. (Just to clarify, cook and the add the next one, not seperately)
Second, to the same pot, add canned tomatos, pasata and italian herbs. Mix and allow to simmer for half hour with occasionall stirring. 
To prepare cheese: I used ricotta (just a small tub), a splash of cream to make it a bit runny and a sprinkle of parmesan and tasty cheese. 

*To layer:* 
1 thin layer of red sauce --> lasagne sheets --> red sauce --> cheese sauce --> mozarella --> lasagne sheets --> red sauce --> cheese sauce --> thicker layer of mozarella

Bake with foil on top for 40 mins, then without foil for 20 mins and then let sit for like 20 mins or so.......
