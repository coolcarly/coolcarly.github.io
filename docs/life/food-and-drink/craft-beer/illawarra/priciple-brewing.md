Principle Brewing is a small brewery located in Fairy Meadow on the Princes Hwy. When I say small, I mean it! It is very small and there are no parking spots available. However, considering that the area is not busy, there is side-street parking available in McGrath street just before Principle Brewing. 

The seating is also limited here, which is why I do not often come here. When I went to Principle Brewing in 2022 with a few friends after Climbing, at 12 pm on a Sunday, we struggled to get a small table. For larger groups, it is standard to book a table for this brewery. 

I've tried many of the beers from here, as many places in the Illawarra has Principle Brewing on tap. Everytime I get a beer from the Principle Brewery, I am never disappointed. They are really amazing! 

After I went surfing on Friday afternoon, I headed to Principle Brewing to refill our Growler. Not many breweries in the Illawarra refill Growlers from other breweries. Despite our Growler being from [Reub Goldberg Brewing Machinem](./rgbm.md), they still filled our 2 L Growler for $25 with the Hazy Pale Ale. Compared to RGBM, this is very cheap! And when I compared the price of a 6-pack ($27), it was similar value - without the added waste.

Lately, we have been pretty busy with Hens and Bucks parties to attend. Nick asked if I wanted to go out, but I insisted on staying home for the evening. I also suggested that I would refill the growler after my morning surf and afternoon time in the lab. 

I arrived at Principle brewery not long after 5 pm. It was not super busy and the foodtruck was parked out front. It would have been a perfect time to sit and socialise. I refilled the growler with a limited release beer that I had tried last time I was there: *Sequoia.* I wanted to try it again, because I thought maybe I had emphasised the taste in my head and it wasn't the true taste. However, once I tried it, I immediately remembered how great it was. 

The refill once again costed $25. Considering that this beer is 6.5 % and we get ~6 drinks out of it, it is really cheap! Â
