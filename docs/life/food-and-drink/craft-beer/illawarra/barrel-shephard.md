### 25.2.23
As we were walking home from the [Wolf & Woman Distillery](../distilleries/wolf-and-woman-distillery) we saw a sign to indicate that there was a brewery around the corner. We followed the sign and ended up at The Barrel Shephard brewery or "blendary". Their specialty are sour beers and their beers are aged in oak! It was a cool mixture of beer and wine. 

The most amazing thing about this place is that they try to use the left-over fruit and vegetables, even grape skins to maranade their drinks, helping the planet by preventing food waste.

Their extensive wine and beers lists left us unsure of what to get in our paddle. We started with the basics: (1) Otto Kolsh (2) Table Beer (8) A short walk and (9) Father mauve. 
The first two were pretty amazing beer. 
- *Otto & Table* *beer* tasted quite light like a lager but didn't have the strange aftertaste of one. It resembled very well beer from France or Belgium. Oh how I love Belgian beer! 
- *A Short Walk* had a strange taste to it. Definitely could taste the tropical scent, but the smell was not nice and the after-taste was almost sickening. We didn't finish this beer. I will not get this one again. 
- *Father Mauve* was really nice! While it was aged in oak, it was infused with Shiraz. This made the beer so tasty! It literally was a mix of both and it was really enjoyable. I would get this one again. 
After our tasting paddle, we ate a burrito each from the Amigos foodtruck that was at the brewery and had one Table Beer each before the brewery closed, at 7 pm. 

The only thing that is not great for this brewery is that it is only open on Fridays 4-7 pm and Saturday's 12-7 pm. I guess it may be from a limited liquor license. Anyway, it is a close walk for us, so it can be an afternoon treat ðŸ˜Š

### 28.4.23: Friday treat 
After work, Nick and I walked with Chip down to the Barrel Sheppard. Tonight, they were serving woodfired pizza from Cirosza pizza. When we arrived, we sat at a table and stools and then I approached the bar and ordered two beers: The Table beer and the Brett Saison. Both had similar tastes, just the Brett Saison was more like a sour, while the table beer was more like a standard lager/belgian beer. 

Next, we ordered pizza: A potato/rosemary pizza initially and wow this pizza was amazing. The sauce that was ontop was 10/10. We ate this with our beers. It matched really well.

*Side note:* Talking to the owner of this pop-up-shop, he said that they were currently setting up a shop in Thirroul. I will definitely go here when it opens. 

After the pizza, we were still hungry so I ordered another: this time the three-cheese. This one was also nice but not as good as the first one. With this pizza, we had a second round of beers. This time, we went with sours: for me, the Afterlife PE and for Nick, I ordered him the Sasura Plum. Both were delicious, but Nick's had more of a kick to it. 

By the time we had finished our beers and pizza, we were ready to leave. I went to the bar and bought a bottle of the Father Mauve that I tasted last time (as they had no more on tap) and then we walked home. By 7.15 pm, we were on the lounge with tea and watching Killing Eve.
