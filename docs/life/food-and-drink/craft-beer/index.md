# Craft Beer
### About

This is a section about craft beer. I also put distilleries underneath as I do not drink spirits often: whiskey, vodka, gin etc so they do not warrant their own section. 

### Overview
Brewing beer is an art and something that really interests me: that we can manipulate micro-organisms to convert sugar to alcohol in the presence of different flavouring agents, to create something as delicious as beer. Looking back at the time I spent pulling out my hair to study for exams, I forgot to admire how awesome chemistry really is. I guess that part comes now. 

Back in 2019, I made a list of all the different equipment that I needed to successfully brew my own beer. I was going to pitch this idea to my dad as he was also very excited about chemistry and beer. Unfortunately, he became quite sick and afterwards, I lost interest. Nowadays, I don't have enough room to brew. From living in apartments to now a townhouse, it just isn't viable. One day when I have my own house, I will start doing this. For now, I will just post about all the amazing breweries that I visit.  

I love that craft beers are booming all around Australia. Every time I go somewhere new, I always head to their local brewery. I really enjoy having so many breweries around me, each trying to put their own ideas into a craft beer. So far the ones I am aware of in the Illawarra: starting in Wollongong with Five-Barrel Brewing and Illawarra Brewery, Fairy Meadow with Principle Brewing, North Wollongong Illawarra Brewing Co., Reub Goldberg Brewing Machine in Tarrawanna, The Barrel Shephard in Bellambi and Resin in Bulli. 

This is basically a blog of the breweries that I have visited, with the beers that I've tried and how I rate it. My motivation behind spending time on this is so that I free up storage space in my mind for other things, and the next time I visit the same Brewery, I can remember what I enjoyed and what I didn't.
