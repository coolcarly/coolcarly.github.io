On Saturday afternoon, around 5pm, Nick and I headed into Wollongong for a few hours to try out 5 Barrel Brewing. I had been here previously with Aliesha and remembered that I had enjoyed the beers a lot. 

We were planning to catch the train in, but the train system was not working well today (I think some power disruptions), so after waiting for 10 minutes at the station we realised that the train was not coming (they cancelled it without notifying us). So we jumped in the car and drove. 

When we arrived, it wasn't too busy so we bought a couple of beers and sat down at a table. I really loved that there were lots of tables to sit at: for couples and for groups. It had the same look as principle brewing, only much bigger. They also had a food truck there, which seems to be apart of the 5-Barrel brewing business and not a seperate entity. Perhaps the food truck was just for show. The burgers that we ordered were quite delicious. I had the mushroom burger which I enjoyed a lot. 

In terms of entertainment, there was a live performer from 6.30 pm. It seems that they have a lot of entertainment to offer during the week and throughout summer.

The beers that we drank (between us) were: 
- *The milk stout*: coffee/chocolatey flavour. Was quite heavy but very nice. 
- *Free fall pale ale*: This was one of my favourites. It is all that you want in a Pale Ale. Amazing
- *Big picture hazy IPA*: Citrusy flavour with a super nice after taste.
- *Little Nipper XPA*: Was better than the average XPA, reminded me a little of the Baxter XPA. 
All the beers that we tasted were enjoyable. There wasn't a single one that I didn't enjoy. 

I highly rate this place. Not sure why it wasn't super busy last night, considering that it closes at 10pm. There were a few larger groups here with kids as well. Seems like a very open and friendly environment.
