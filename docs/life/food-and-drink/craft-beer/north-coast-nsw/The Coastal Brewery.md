# The Coastal Brewery
- Location: 3 Dalman St, Forster, NSW 2428

### 7-9 April 2023
Over the Easter long weekend, Nick and I headed to Forster for a small getaway in a campervan. See my post in [[Forster 2023]]. I had previously read about this brewery: they had travelled around NSW for various craft beer festivals. They had really good reviews as well. This was our first stop in Forster on Good Friday. 

Nick and I had a Paddle each (of course we shared all 8 beers). All the beers were pretty amazing - especially the Hearts NEPA. This was my favourite and I really enjoyed every minute of it. Nick didn't have a favourite but he did comment about how great the beers were.

On this day, they were serving food from a BBQ food truck. Unfortunately, chip was really unsettled from the trip in that we had to leave straight after the paddle. Nevermind though, because the following day, we came back! 

After a day out at Old Bar Village, we stopped in for another beer at the brewery. I enjoyed a Hearts NEPA and Nick an IPA. We also brought in our own cheese and crackers as I had previously read online that they allow external food. Also, the food truck wasn't operating at that time. 

This beer for sure deserves many awards.
