There are three components to this dish: 
1. Tomato & Cucumber salad with Tzatziki
2. Cous-cous
3. Tumeric & black pepper tofu. 

This is for *3 servings.

I like to prepare the tofu a few days before - because the longer you leave to marinade, the better it is! 

I marinaded the tofu with a Tumeric and black pepper [recipe](https://www.burlapandbarrel.com/blogs/recipes/turmeric-and-black-pepper-tofu) that I found online. For the 500 g block of Tofu, I doubled the ingredients:

### To prepare the tofu
1. Cut the Tofu into large rectangles or triangles. Thinner pieces are more crispy, but thicker pieces are softer. 
2. Combine 2 tsp of tumeric, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tsp black pepper, 4 tsp cornstarch and sprinkle over the tofu. Rub the mixture into the tofu pieces and then cover. Leave for as long as desired. 
3. In a non-stick fry pan/well oiled frypan, fry the tofu pieces for ~8 min each side. 

### The salad: 
1. Slide the cucumber, halve the cherry tomatoes and dice the red onion. 
2. Combine incredients and serve with a spoon of tzatziki. Note: I thought feta cheese could be compatible here. 
3. Cook the cous cous. Note: we used the flavoured cous-cous from Woolworths. You may need to mix everything together to give it flavour. 

### The Cous Cous: 
1. Cook according to packet instructions.
