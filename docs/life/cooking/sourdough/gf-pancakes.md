Recently, Nick and I relocated from Wollongong to Sutherland Shire. It has been so crazy and wonderful for many reasons. One of them is due to the fact that I now have a large kitcehn and can bake to my heart's content. m

When we first moved in, I decided that I wanted to also be able to bake for my gluten free friends who would visit. I therefore decided to convert my sourdough starter to a gluten free one - basically by gradually decreasing the amount of wheat flour that I fed the mother, and adding more and more gluten free flour. 

Today, Dani visited to check out the house and catch up a bit. For lunch, I threw some gluten free pancakes together. They turned out suprisingly well. However, as expected with gluten free pancakes, they were less fluffy compared to my previous pancakes. Nontheless, the walnuts and blueberries in this recipe added some great taste to it. Dani even rated them 9/10! She also requested cheese to eat with the pancakes. I was dumfounded.. Cheese?! But omg they tasted good with cheese. Nick ate them with maple syrup. 

Anyway the recipe goes like this: 

Serving size: 10 pancakes
Dry Ingredients: 
81 g oat flour 
20 g buckwheat flour 
50 g walnuts (crushed)
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder

Wet Ingredients: 
1 egg
3/4 cup milk
90 sourdough starter (gluten free) 
20 g honey 

Additional ingredients: 
50 g blueberries (defrosted)
* Banana also works well here. 

Method: 
1. Combine all dry ingredients 
2. Whisk egg. Add milk, honey and sourdough starter. 
3. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk together. 
4. For large, full blueberries, Blend in the blueberries.
5. Heat pan with Ghee and fry pancake mixture on medium/low heat (4-5 for induction)
6. Serve with cheese or maple syrup.
