After feeding my sourdough starter 4 hours prior, it appeared to have almost doubled in size. I used the entirety of the container (104 g) to prepare bagel dough, based off this [recipe](https://littlespoonfarm.com/sourdough-bagels-recipe/). 

**Ingredients:**
104 g active starter<br/>
230 g warm water <br/>
2 tbsp honey <br/>
500 g bread flour <br/>
2 tsp salt <br/>

**Methods:**
1. Add water and honey to the starter
2. Add flour and salt and mix to combine. 
3. If it is very floury and all the flour is not incorporated, add a little more water. 
4. With your hands, massage the dough for 5-10 minutes. 
5. Cover and let it sit at room temperature overnight (they say 6-8 hours until it has doubled in size, but I wanted to go to bed so I left it overnight).
6. Place in the fridge in the morning.
7. Refrigerate until you crave bagels. 
8. The morning of (~2 days later), pull dough out of the fridge and divide into 8 balls. 
9. Use your finger to poke a hole in the middle. 
10. Let the dough sit on the kitchen bench for a second proofing, covered with a bread towel/tea towel.
11. Boil the bagels for 4 minutes each.
12. Bake at 220 Â°C for 25 minutes. 

**Notes:** I started with plain bagels. To make blueberry bagels, I would substitute honey (or decrease the amount of honey) for frozen blueberries. 
Once you have boiled the bagels, you can also top them. Popular choices include Sesame Seeds, salt or the Everything Bagel seasoning.
