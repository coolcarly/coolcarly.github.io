After feeding my sourdough starter 4 hours prior, it appeared to have almost doubled in size. I used the entirety of the container (104 g) to prepare bagel dough, based off this [recipe](https://littlespoonfarm.com/sourdough-bagels-recipe/). 

**Ingredients:**
104 g active starter<br/>
223 g warm water <br/>
2 tbsp honey <br/>
500 g bread flour <br/>
2 tsp salt <br/>

**Methods:**
1. Add water and honey to the starter
2. Add flour and salt and mix to combine. 
3. If it is very floury and all the flour is not incorporated, add a little more water. 
4. With your hands, massage the dough for 5-10 minutes. 
5. Cover and let it sit at room temperature overnight (they say 6-8 hours until it has doubled in size, but I wanted to go to bed so I left it overnight).
6. Place in the fridge in the morning.
7. Refrigerate until you crave bagels.
