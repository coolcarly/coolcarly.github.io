### About
This sidebar is about everything science related. While starting to write up my thesis, I decided that I needed somewhere to write things "in plain english" or as simple as possible. Not only did this improve my writing but it also helped to cement ideas in my mind. 

Of course my true passion lies with [Polymer science](/docs/science/polymer-science/terms.md) but other random terms that are important for my PhD or life as a scientist will also be posted here. Basically anything sciency that I feel like writing about will be in this side-bar. Stay tuned.
