title: Benzene as a hand cleaner
---
One day in the lab, Pawel (my supervisor) and I were talking about how something can be considered friendly and non-toxic but years later be decided to be a carcinogen. It's not that it wasn't toxic previously, it's just that all classifications are numbers games. 
Pawel then insighted me on the fact that benzene was previously used to clean hands. Yes you heard (well actually read it but I'm reading it in my head like I would speak it), **BENZENE!!** 

[Benzene](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/benzene#:~:text=Benzene%20is%20a%20colorless%20or,natural%20and%20man%2Dmade%20processes.) is a carcinogenic chemical found in cigarettes. It is a terrible chemical but still useful in chemistry as a solvent. 
Therefore, we should try to avoid exposure to any chemical in the lab, as something menial like ethanol or acetone may be shown in later years to be harmful with repeated exposure. Thats the key here: **repeated exposure.** Since I am in the lab and will be for a long time, we need to limit our exposure. 

Me, I just avoid using harsh chemicals and will stick to polymers.
