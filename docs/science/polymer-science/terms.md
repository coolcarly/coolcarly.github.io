# Terms in Polymer Science
Like many other fields of research, polymer science has it's own jargon. There are many terms that are used to describe the physical and chemical characteristics of the materials that we use. Perhaps even the word *Polymer* is a jargon word to someone who does not study science. I've had to simplify the word to my family in order to explain my research field in plain english. Therefore, this page is dedicated to defining simple terms in polymer science, starting with the very basic term [Polymers](./polymers.md). 

### Key terms:
- [Regioregularity](/docs/science/polymer-science/properties/regioregularity.md)
- [Tacticity](/science/polymer-science/properties/tacticity.md)
- [Band-gaps](./conducting-polymers/Conduction/conduction-band-gap.md)
