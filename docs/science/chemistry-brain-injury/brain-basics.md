## Brain biology
I am in no way an expert in the biology of the brain. In fact, since my first semester in neuropsychology, I never read about the brain again. Therefore, I will try to be as simple as I can be to avoid criticism. 

The brain is the powerhouse of the body. It determines the way we feel, learn, and perceive the world. The brain is divided into three areas: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. There is much literature evidence that show specific regions of the brain are responsible for specific functions. For example, the forebrain (or cerebellum) is involved with movement, memories, thoughts, and actions; the midbrain controls reflexes, while the hindbrain which controls vital functions such as heart rate. Drug overdoses are catastrophic when the drug binds to a receptor in the hindbrain. This is the reason that respiration is lowered. 

The way that our body communicates with the brain is through neurons. If we learn to do something with our hands, neuronal connections will be made in the brain such that we remember it. Over our lifetime, these networks will continuously change and adapt. 

## About neurons
Neurons are the cells that send messages around your body through chemical and electrochemical signals. They are made by the body through stem cells. As I did my PhD with a group of people from a broad area of scientific disciplines, I would often participate in lunch time conversations surrounding “cell work”. My friends that were doing PhD’s in cell biology would often complain of the tedious and time-consuming nature of maintaining and differentiating cells. I was never envious of them. But I did learn a lot from them. “Cell differentiation” is basically treating a stem cell to a particular environment to generate a specific cell, in her case a neuronal cell. 

The way that neurons connect to other neurons is through a space called a synapse or synaptic cleft. The post-synaptic cleft is the space after the neuron terminal, while the pre-synaptic cleft is the space before the neuron “head” or dendrites. The electrical signals that are carried along a neuron are termed action potentials. Action potentials are governed by the flux of ions such as sodium and potassium. When the neuron is resting, it exhibits a potential of -60 to -70 mV inside the cell. Since the cell is more negative, it is termed “hyperpolarisation”. As the sodium ion is positively charged, it will diffuse toward the negative potential. As more sodium ions enter the cell, the sodium ion channel will change in conformation and allow more sodium to flux into the cell. At equilibrium, the cell will be at +60 mV and therefore “depolarised”. In response to depolarisation, the potassium channel will open. Potassium will flow out of the cell to induce repolarisation. As the cell reaches the hyperpolarised state, the sodium and potassium channels will close. 

Action potentials are initiated through the binding of neurotransmitters to a significant number of receptors (differs depending on the neurotransmitter). As the action potential reaches the synapse, Ca2+channels open to allow Ca2+ to flow into the synaptic cleft. As Ca2+ binds to its relevant sensor. This triggers the release of neurotransmitters to carry on the electrical signal.

## Neurotransmitters
There are many neurotransmitters that exist in the body and the brain. A common one is serotonin – the “happy neurotransmitter”, or dopamine – the “reward” neurotransmitter. Adrenaline is responsible for the fight response, while acetocholine is for the resting response. These neurotransmitters exist all over the body. Binding of these neurotransmitters to their relevant post or presynaptic receptor sends the relevant responses to the brain through action potentials.
