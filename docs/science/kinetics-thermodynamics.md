## Kinetics vs thermodynamics
Kinetics refers to the *speed of reaction.*

The general formula for a chemical reaction is: 
A + B â†’ C + D

The side of the reaction with A and B are termed reactants, while C and D are the products. 

In a kinetically favoured reaction, the formation of C and D are fast. 

This is different to a thermodynamically favoured reaction, where C and D are the most energetically favoured product.
