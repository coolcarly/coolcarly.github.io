### About 
In this sidebar, I will post about things related to my PhD. I will try to add things before 2023 (when I created the website) but this may take some time. To see the science that I did during my PhD, check out the [Science](/docs/science/index.md) sidebar. I plan to upload my entire thesis in "plain english" on this website - but don't expect to see this until next year, when I finally submit. 

<CusdisComments
  attrs={{
    pageId: frontMatter.id,
    pageTitle: frontMatter.title,
    pageUrl: frontMatter.__resourcePath,
  }}
