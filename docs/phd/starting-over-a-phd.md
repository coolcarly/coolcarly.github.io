Five months left until I want to be finished! 8 months until I **have to submit.** Here, I will reflect on some of the things I know now that I should have done differently in my research, and things that I will carry with me throughout my career. 

First off, coming into a brand new field that I have never studied before, I should not have expected myself to know everything. My supervisors did not expect me to know anything either. I wish that I had asked more questions, especially to Pawel. Sometimes he scares me and sometimes I get a little bit insecure from my imposter syndrome, but I am sure that Pawel enjoys answering questions as much as I do. 

As the pandamic hit us around the start of my PhD, I was out of the lab for a while. This was a great opportunity to read and write - which I did with the review article that we published, in early 2021. However, once we were back in the lab, I spent a lot of time in the lab - sometimes 12 hours a day. I never thought the data I had was good enough, so I kept doing the same experiments hoping to get better data. Maybe this is what everyone experiences, because even Einstein said "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results". This famous quote must have been from some of his early experiences. If I could do it all over, I would have accepted my bad results and moved on.
