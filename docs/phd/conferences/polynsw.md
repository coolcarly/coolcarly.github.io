## 2023 ECR symposium
*(20.10.2023) *As I write, I am sitting in my final symposium of my PhD: PolyNSW. This society is made up of researchers around NSW with interests in polymer science. This particular symposium is an early career researcher event at University of New South Wales. I submitted an abstract several months ago and found out last week that it was accepted for a talk. Yesterday, I received  the final version of the prpgram, only to realise that my talk is the last one. 

Lately, I've struggled with staying focused for long periods of time. This was definitely a challenge for me and from the minute I found out that I was presenting in the afternoon, I was almost prepared to tell them that I can't make it. However, it seemed like a missed opportunity to pull out of the presentation when I love them a lot. Therefore, I decided to attend; afterall, you don't grow until you push yourself outside of your comfort zone. 

*(21.10.2023)* At this symposium, I got to meet a few new people and catch up with colleagues and old friends from the University of Sydney. By the end of it and my talk, I was exhausted and immediately rushed to go home. However, I was glad that I went. It was the last opportunity to showcase myself as a PhD student. I also feel like I had the chance to promote myself and hopefully I gave people only good vibes. 

In my talk, I tried as best as I could to keep it light, as it was the last presentation of the 9 hour day! I made a few jokes about my PhD and how I was glad that it is over. In reality, I'm not sure how I feel but I am definitely keen to move on and get a job and start to build my life and career! It's just a shame that I will part from this amazing community. I truely felt like I met some amazing people who were genuinely interested in me as a scientist and as a person. I loved how we all shared similar interests in polymers and that a lot of people remembered me from conferences that I had previously attended. I feel this is a community where I belong.
