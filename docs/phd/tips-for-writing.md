title: Tips for Writing 
---
I'm going to start this post with an apology, because there is no secret to writing. Nor is there a "cheat way" to write your thesis. You just do it. 

When I asked for tips and tricks in early August 2023 on how to effectively write my thesis, some people would say "you just gotta do it. Sit down and do it." When people said this to me, I would roll my eyes. Isn't it obvious that I need to do that? Why won't anyone tell me their secrets? I guess for someone who writes and submits a thesis and then joins the workforce, you forget what it was like to write a thesis. That's why I'm writing this page now, while it is fresh in my mind. 

There is no set way that you should write. Everyone has their own ways. I know someone who forced themself to go to the library everyday to write, which helped them overcome the motivation battle. I know others who used video games as a reward - with 1 hour of full focus, followed by 1 hour of gaming.... and so on. To me, these strategies would not work. For one, in a library, I would probably fall asleep. And as for video games, I can't think of a worse way to spend my time. 

#### My strategy was compartmentalisation.
 I would seperate sections of my thesis and give myself goals for the day. When I first started writing my introduction section, I was spending half a day writing and then half a day in the lab. My routine involved writing a few paragraphs or a mini-review about one really specific topic. I would literally set out a new word document each day and write the topic as the heading. For example, "What are conducting polymers?" Each of these documents turned out to form a subsection of the chapter. 

 Early on, in my Fourth Year (around March 2023), an additional strategy that I used to channel my bad vibes in a good way, was to work from home and write on the days that I hated my PhD. I would think to myself "I really want to get out of here." I would use this very negative feeling to write. You want to finish ASAP right? Well on those days that I was sick of my PhD work, I really wanted to do something new. It was a driving force for writing. Even if you don't want to write or feel that you're not ready to write, I suggest you try it! It may work out well for you. 

#### How did this strategy help me?
It was so helpful, because whenever I started thinking about the **whole** thesis, the 10,000 word document, I was so overwhelmed and would freak out, rendering me unproductive. By seperating the sections, it helped to seperate the writing from the thesis. I believe that this strategy really developed an interest in writing for me, which is what inspired me to start this blog. I cannot wait for thesis writing to officially be over so that I can write random little articles or "mini-reviews" of topics that I would like to learn more about. 


#### What about when I am feeling really de-motivated?
Whenever I was feeling demotivated, I would either go and have a lay down to recharge, seperate my screens into two and watch/listen to Netflix shows that I have already seen or do that while writing my methods section. The methods section is tedious work, but does not require much focus. Therefore, working through that is something that can be done when you feel least motivated. For me, this usually occured on a Friday while I was waiting for Beer O'clock. 

#### How long did it take me to write?
Throughout my phd, I would always write things down. However, I started writing my introduction in July 2023. I started with half a day writing and half a day in the lab. This lasted until late August, when I stopped doing lab work and focused on writing. I finished writing my first draft at the end of October. I suggest to give yourself at least 6 months of writing time - combining lab and writing together initially. If you are writing full-time, I would suggest 3-4 months. 

#### A final word of advice
Whether or not you think that my strategy for writing is helpful, writing a little bit everyday helps. Early on in the writing stage of my thesis, I met with my GP and she asked me how my PhD was going. I was feeling a bit demotivated about writing and the whole finishing process. She said to me "if you write a little bit everyday, eventually you will finish." These words were so basic but they were so meaningful! If you give yourself enough time, all you need to do is write a little bit each day and at some point, you will finish, right?
