I used to be fuelled by the thought of travelling the world. From 2016-2019, I had been in and out of the country a couple times per year. I backpacked Asia, Europe (twice), travelled around Australia. 

Late in 2019 after completing my honours thesis, I was working in the lab as a Research Assistant under my PhD supervisor. In December 2019, I was awarded my PhD scholarship and had met for coffee with David. We spoke about the plan for my PhD  - the ideas for travelling, lab visits and conferences. It sounded so good! 

Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were not allowed to leave a 5 km radius of our homes. This dramatically changed everything. For the first two years of my PhD, the only conferences that I attended were online. I barely gave any presentations. It killed me that I couldn't travel anywhere, because there was so much that I wanted to do and see. 

Once international travel was back in late 2021, it was really expensive. The first conference that I attended during my PhD was in Queensland (July 2022): the RACI congress. This conference was awesome! I met so many amazing people in different disciplines of chemistry. I grew my LinkedIn network and I had the best time. What's even better is that the dates overlapped with the Gold Coast marathon - the weekend before the conference, I flew to the Gold Coast to run the 42.2 km! It was an epic week. 

The second conference that I attended was the Polymer Pacific (PPC17) also in Queensland in December 2022. A similar polymer crowd attended this conference, and I met more amazing chemists and polymer scientists. I had so much fun that on the last night, I stayed out until 4 am and missed my flight home. Lucky for me, I have Nick to help me come home (by buying me a new flight - which I paid him back for) and a kind sister to pick me up from the airport. 

That was a funny day. The new flight was delayed and I didn't land in Sydney until after 12 pm. It was Thursday, and my supervisors still wanted to meet. David asked that I came to work, so I did. I was so stinky and tired. We worked on submitting a new abstract for the BioEl in February 2023 - which was accepted for a poster. 

Both conferences in Queensland inspired me and motivated me to be a better scientist and to work harder in the lab. The feedback from my supervisor in my annual progress review (APR) was pretty amazing - it seemed that he could see how my confidence was growing as a scientist and at these conferences. 

The next thing was to send me to an international lab for a visit. Initially it was early 2023, where I was going to visit a lab in the UK, University of Cambridge. At the same time, I was going to present at the Bioelectronics conference in Austria. By the time February came along, I wasn't keen to go as my lab work still needed more attention. Also the potential lab that David wanted me to visit wasn't interested in my work. Thus, travel was delayed for me. 

The next thought was for me to go to Japan to visit Prof. Takashi Kato, an academic who I had met at the PPC17 conference in December 2022. I gave the details to David, but I heard nothing. This was another opportunity missed. Perhaps it was wise because I don't believe we could have got any interesting information from this lab visit. Furthermore, since I am in my third year, I did not want to waste a significant amount of time in a different lab. I am ready to finish my thesis, yet I still have quite a bit of lab work to do. I expressed my concerns to my supervisor, but he still thought it was a good idea to send me somewhere. I am very greatful for him wanting to do this for me. If it was any other supervisor, I don't think I would be going anywhere. 

*This leads me to New Zealand.* My supervisor has a friend who is a Professor of Chemistry, [Prof. Keith Gordon](https://www.otago.ac.nz/chemistry/people/otago668566.html), over at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. The lab visit involves me learning Raman Spectroscopy and analysing my materials for <2 weeks: from 21 May til 2 June. Following New Zealand, I will be heading to the USA for a conference: [International Symposium on Functional Ï€-Electron Systems](https://conferences.coned.ncsu.edu/fpi15/fpi-15/). Here, I will be giving a 20 minute presentation on my work.

Unfortunately, I was not prepared in time which resulted in another cancellation of the NZ trip (I was pretty relieved when David said we should cancel). I don't know why I don't want to travel. The thought of leaving Australia is making me very nervous. It's so strange because pre-COVID I would have jumped at these opportunities. 

Yet, travelling is inevitable. As of 2pm today, flights are booked for New York. I fly out on Tuesday 6th June 2023. The plan is to spend 1 week in New York for leisure before heading to Rayleigh, North Carolina for the pi-electrons conference. I think once I get back into the travel mode, I will be more excited for this trip.

Over the month of June, I travelled in the USA - see my Trips post [USA 2023](/docs/life/trips/usa.md). It was amazing and gave me a final push to get going and finish lab work. Over the last few weeks, I have written a significant amount, learned to do Raman Spectroscopy and now preparing for the potential NZLD lab visit (post-poned til September).
