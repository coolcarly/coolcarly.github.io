## How to navigate
This website is about random stuff, science and life! 




## About me
- Studied a BSc(hons), with a major in Chemistry and [polymer science](/science/polymer-science/polymers) at the University of Sydney. 
- Completed my PhD in [Organic bioelectronics](/science/organic-bioelectronics) in June 2024 at the University of Wollongong.
- I love baking and all things yeast. Check out my posts in [sourdough](/life/cooking/sourdough) or [bread and pastry](/life/cooking/bread-and-pastry)
- I love to try different Craft beer and wine. It is an art-form that I appreciate a lot. 
- I am a volunteer surf lifesaver [SLSA](life/surf-lifesaving) & a member of [North Wollongong Surf Club](https://nwslsc.com.au/)
- In my free time, I write short articles and I practice my Python skills. 
- My life goal is contribute something great to science/the community. I am not sure what that will be, ask me again in a few years.
- I am using this blog to improve my writing skills, but also as a tool to improve my mental wellbeing. I feel that once I write things down, they are released from my mind and I've freed up space for other thoughts. 
- I plan to make this a platform where I share my experiences and hopefully it may help someone going through the same situation. 

- At the moment, I am in love with making bread. [Follow my bread making journey](/life/cooking/bread-and-pastry/bread).
