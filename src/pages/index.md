## About me
- Studied a BSc(hons), with a major in Chemistry and polymer science 
- Currently in 3rd year of PhD in polymer science, with an application in organic bioelectronics
- I love to try different Craft beer and wine. It is an art-form that I appreciate a lot. 
- I am a volunteer surf lifesaver [SLSA](life/surf-lifesaving) & a member of [North Wollongong Surf Club](https://nwslsc.com.au/)
- If I am not working on my thesis or hanging out with Nick or Chip, I spend most of my time at the beach paddling or swimming. I really love that community vibe. 
- I am using this blog to improve my writing skills, but also as a tool to improve my mental wellbeing.
