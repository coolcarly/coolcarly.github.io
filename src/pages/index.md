## How to navigate
This website is about random stuff, science and life! 

Anything that I add to this website will be updated in the [blog navigation bar](/blog), along with random anecdotes that didn't fit in any of the other sections. 

I am still working to make this better. 

## About me
- Studied a BSc(hons), with a major in Chemistry and [polymer science](/science/polymer-science/polymers) 
- Currently in 3rd year of PhD in polymer science, with an application in [Organic bioelectronics](/science/organic-bioelectronics)
- I love to try different Craft beer and wine. It is an art-form that I appreciate a lot. 
- I am a volunteer surf lifesaver [SLSA](life/surf-lifesaving) & a member of [North Wollongong Surf Club](https://nwslsc.com.au/)
- If I am not working on my thesis or hanging out with Nick or Chip, I spend most of my time at the beach [paddling or swimming](/life/swimming-and-surfing). I really love that community vibe. 
- I am using this blog to improve my writing skills, but also as a tool to improve my mental wellbeing.
