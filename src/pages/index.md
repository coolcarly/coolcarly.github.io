## How to navigate
This website is about random stuff, science and life! 

Anything that I add to this website will be updated in the [blog navigation bar](/blog), along with random anecdotes that didn't fit in any of the other sections. 

I am still working to make this better. 

If you want to comment on some content, you can send a comment via the Home tab in each side-bar: Life, Science or PhD. 

## About me
- Studied a BSc(hons), with a major in Chemistry and [polymer science](/science/polymer-science/polymers) 
- I've recently submitted my PhD in [Organic bioelectronics](/science/organic-bioelectronics).
- I love to try different Craft beer and wine. It is an art-form that I appreciate a lot. 
- I am a volunteer surf lifesaver [SLSA](life/surf-lifesaving) & a member of [North Wollongong Surf Club](https://nwslsc.com.au/)
- In my free time, I write short articles and I practice my Python skills. 
- My life goal is contribute something great to science/the community. I am not sure what that will be, ask me again in a few years.
- I am using this blog to improve my writing skills, but also as a tool to improve my mental wellbeing. I feel that once I write things down, they are released from my mind and I've freed up space for other thoughts. 
- I plan to make this a platform where I share my experiences and hopefully it may help someone going through the same situation.
