replication<a href="#science-of-yeast-replication" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Science of yeast replication" title="Direct link to Science of yeast replication">​</a></h2><p>Harvesting wild yeast to create a sourdough starter is pretty straight forward and robust. The yeast that I harvested is actually known as <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>. Did you know that it is a eukaryotic unicellular organism? This means that it exhibits a membrane bound nucleus, as do plants and animals. As we are multicellular organisms, yeast provides opportunities to study the behaviour of eukaryotic cells and has solved many of our questions about life on Earth. </p><p>Did you also know that yeast reproduce both sexually (with a mate) and asexually (through budding). The route that the yeast will follow depends on the environmental cues present. Yeast cells at the Growth stage of life can undergo cell differentiation. During this stage, they decide whether to divide into haploid cells (which allows them to mate with partner cells), asexually replicate or form stationary cells (which can age). Two images are shown in Fig 1: including (A) budding cells diving into mother and daughter yeast cells (asexual reproduction) and (B) Meosis of the haploid cells to form 2 copies of each chromosome. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/yeast2-ee6d3f8690787752ed214f308a71cc9d.JPG" width="376" height="179" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 1. (A) Budding cells expressing red fluorescent protein and (B) sporulating cells stained with the green fluorescent protein. Taken from <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05835" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a></em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now you ask, why would they divide and mate when they can asexually reproduce? While asexual reproduction is the easiest form of replication, sexual reproduction produces diploids (2 copies of each chromosome), which are more stable and allow for an increase in genetic diversity, which is a driver for a strong population (As a chemist, think entropy). Thus in most cases, they will choose to mate. </p><p>As previously stated, in order for yeast to sexually reproduce, it must divide into a haploid cell. A haploid cell is one copy of each chromosome and therefore is labelled as having a sex, MATa or MATά (which are named after the DNA sequences present in the yeast cells). Both types of haploids secrete pheromones to attract one another. The MATα secretes a soluble α-factor, while MATa seretes a fatty acid modified peptide, which is excreted from the cell via an ABC transporter (a protein on the cell membrane that facilitates active transport). The high lipophillicity of the peptide, causes it to remain in the plasma membrane, while the soluble factor travels through the media. The yeast cells can polarise (change shape) according to the direction of the pheromones secreted. Once the two opposite haploids come together, they mate to form a diploid zygote. Meosis (a process of sex cell replication) creates 4x replicates of the DNA to form four haploid cells, contained within the ascosphere walls. In the presence of nutrients, germination and gamete production occurs, forming a diploid cell (Shown in Fig 2).</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/yeast1-325bf81da0cafa9cdc386741a13c08b0.JPG" width="638" height="133" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 2. Yeast sexual replication. Taken from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.130008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a></em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>It should be obvious that with a high yeast cell density, there is a higher opportunity for sexual reproduction. But what about when there is a lack of nutrients available? Starvation induces meiosis and sporulation in an attempt to preseve the genetic diversity but, remain in a non-dividing state. Once nurtients are present, further germination and gamete production can occur. It is for this reason that meoitic spores are resistant to stresses and desication.</p><p>In summary, yeast is robust! It is so cool and there are so many wonderful things you can do with it, which I will talk about alot in my blog in the future. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="starting-equipment">Starting equipment<a href="#starting-equipment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Starting equipment" title="Direct link to Starting equipment">​</a></h2><p>I started with the following equipment/ingredients: </p><ul><li>Rye flour*</li><li>tap water**</li><li>2 x 500 g jars</li><li>food scale</li><li>Paper towel and rubber band (or breathable lid)</li></ul><p><strong>Some general things to note:</strong></p><ul><li>I chose rye flour as the starting flour because it is meant to have a higher level of good bacteria and enzymes to aid in healthy fermentation.</li><li>Some say that you should use bottled water for the initial week (because chlorine is present in tap water, which kills all bacteria). I filled a drink bottle with tap water and left it overnight. By doing this, the chlorine dissapates from the water. You could also use boiled water (cooled down of course).</li><li>The ideal environment is 24–28 °C. As it is winter, sometimes I used warmer water (30°C) and wrapped it in a towel to warm it up.</li><li>While the starter is on the bench at room temperature, you need to cover it with a breathable lid: such as paper towel and rubber band. Once you place it in the fridge (because you are not using it frequently), you can put a lid on (but very loosely). This is because the microorganisms in the starter are constantly converting the carbohydrates/sugars in the flour to carbon dioxide. If you do not let the gas out, then there will be a build up of pressure in the gar, leading to an explosion. </li></ul><p>Here I have listed the method that I used to create my sourdough starter. For the first month of life, I fed (and plan to feed) it everyday. This post therefore covers the first month with references to things I&#x27;ve baked with it (where appropriate).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cultivating-wild-yeast-using-flour-and-water">Cultivating wild yeast using flour and water<a href="#cultivating-wild-yeast-using-flour-and-water" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cultivating wild yeast using flour and water" title="Direct link to Cultivating wild yeast using flour and water">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1-friday-14-june-2024"><em>Day 1, Friday 14 June 2024</em><a href="#day-1-friday-14-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-1-friday-14-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-1-friday-14-june-2024">​</a></h3><p>First, I weighed out my jar. Next, I measured 20 g of rye flour and 30 g of water and combined. The mixture was as viscous as a &quot;thick pancake batter.&quot; The jar was covered with a breathable lid (in my case, paper towl) and left to sit at room temperature for 24 hours. Note here that the temperature will determine the speed at which the bacteria will grow. At the moment, it is winter so the temperatures will be max 20 °C. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-2-saturday-15-june-2024"><em>Day 2, Saturday 15 June 2024</em><a href="#day-2-saturday-15-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-2-saturday-15-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-2-saturday-15-june-2024">​</a></h3><p>I repeated the process.

I emptied half of the contents into a new container and discarded the rest. Then I repeated the process from yesterday: 20 g of rye flour and 25 g of water. Note: I used less water this time, because that was enough to form a thick paste with consistency similar to yesterday. I made note of the temperature of the room, which was 18.5 °C. </p><p>After covering the glass jar, again with a breathable cover - in this case paper towel, I then put a rubber band around the jar to mark the level of the yeast.
