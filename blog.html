From my <a href="/blog/2024/May/spinach_cheese_triangles">previous post</a>, I prepared puff pastry with flour, butter and water. The puff pastry was then used to make spinach and cheese triangles. They were very nice, but the pastry was very sweet. Therefore, I wanted to create a recipe that was less sweet and more to my tastes. To achieve this, I decreased the amount of butter and added oil and extra salt. </p><p>The ingredients were as follows: </p><div align="center"> 400 g plain flour <br> 1 tsp salt <br> 53 g butter <br> 1 tbsp olive oil <br> 155 g water <br> </div><p><em>Method:</em>
In a large mixing bowl, the flour and salt were combined. Butter was chopped into small squares and using my hands, the flour and butter were rubbed together creating a crumbly flour. Next, the oil was added and the flour/butter mixture and oil were gently rubbed together (now, the texture was more crumbly). Finally, I added 155 g water (Note, I weight out the water, but it would equate to 155 mL). and used my hands to mix. The mixture was crumbly, but good enough to roll out. With floured hands and a lightly floured surface, I rolled the dough out into a long, thin pastry (maybe 0.5 cm thick?). Next I folded it several times onto itself and covered in plastic wrap. The covered dough was placed in the fridge.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pastry2-9f2e8275824cd100584942f5cd58d64f.jpeg" width="1280" height="383" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: From preparing the crumbling dough by rubbing ingredients together, to rolling out the dough and folding it into a plastic wrap</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I think 2 hours is adequate enough to chill the pastry, however, I left it in the fridge until I wanted to use it. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="further-preparation">Further preparation<a href="#further-preparation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Further preparation" title="Direct link to Further preparation">​</a></h2><p><em>2.6.24</em><br>
I pulled the dough out of the fridge and unwrapped it. There were folding marks present, however once I rolled it out with a rolling pin, the dough became smooth again. I tried to roll it out as thin as I could and then cut it into three sections. One filled the inside of a pan, and the other is to act as a pie top (for dinner tomorrow night, see image 1 below). Both were covered and placed in the fridge again. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pastry3-8e28a7de5c3324474ce20bb3bc1581a4.jpeg" width="1280" height="554" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: Preparation of a pie (left) and the cheese triangles after baking (right)</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cheese-trianges">Cheese trianges<a href="#cheese-trianges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cheese trianges" title="Direct link to Cheese trianges">​</a></h3><p>With the third section, I divided it into five small triangles. 1 tsp of filling was placed in the centre of each triangle and then it was folded onto itself several times to make a triangle like shape.

Over the past few weeks, I have had the desire to improve my baking skills, so I have invested time into making a perfect loaf of bread. With every small tweak in a recipe, I realised that there are dramatic changes, which motivated me to write about the changes in bread quality in relation to the chemistry. </p><p>Flour contains proteins glutenin and gliadin, which combine in the presence of water to form gluten (Fig 1). Prior to the addition of water, glutenin exists as a colloid. Upon addition of water to the flour, the chains are allowed to stretch, seperate, and form new disulfide linkages. These disulfide linkages create a network of glutenin polymer that produces the strength and elasticity of bread dough. At the same time, the smaller gliadin proteins will disperse through the glutenin polymer network, which allows the bread to &quot;rise&quot;. It is the constituent that facilitates formation of the gluten network. Due to it&#x27;s self-assembling properties (as it is highly hydrophobic), it will associate into spherical particles and absorb other nutrients such as vitamin E. Thus, the quality of the gluten network that forms is dependent on the type of flour that is used.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Schematic of gluten formation" src="/assets/images/bread_schematic-2d7f68f1f1f8c5e36c0a766763aedc22.jpeg" width="1280" height="453" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 1. Schematic of gluten formation</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Mixing and kneading of the flour/water mixture encourages the gluten network to further develop. During this process, carbon dioxide is incorporated, producing a more porous dough once it is baked. Yet, we dont want the gluten networks to be so strong that they become chewy and tough. This is the reason that people turn to a &quot;no-knead&quot; method. Sometimes, a high water content is enough to facilitate formation of strong gluten networks. </p><p>Yet, there is one more ingredient that is required to create the gluten network... and that is salt. As mentioned in the <a href="/science/salt">&quot;salting-out&quot;</a> post, salt helps to decrease the water content. In this instance, salt will remove water from the protein/polymer network to increase the strength and elasicity. </p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="making-the-initial-loaf">Making the initial loaf<a href="#making-the-initial-loaf" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Making the initial loaf" title="Direct link to Making the initial loaf">​</a></h2><p>The initial recipe that I started with came from Nagi: <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-yeast-bread-recipe-no-knead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RecipeTinEats</a>. The ingredients required were:</p><p align="center"> 450 g flour <br> 2 tsp yeast <br> 2 tsp salt <br> 375 mL of warm watern (~40 °C) </p><p>First, I started off with a &quot;no kneading&quot; approach to bread making. I was unsure of the measurements for the yeast. I had the large container of active yeast as well as the packets. I initially used the packets, and with a quick google search I saw that 7 g was an equivalent of 2 tsp of yeast. Therefore, in my first attempt to make this bread, I activated one packet of the yeast in warm water. The bread was left for a few hours in a warm-ish environment to rise, and then it was moulded into a round ball and baked using the dutch oven.</p><p>After baking, the bread was very tough to cut and very dense, but it was still quite tasty and full of flavour. These bread flavours arise from fermentation. The high density is possibly attributed to a low water content. Thus, for the subsequent loaves, I went for weighing out the ingredients using a scale instead of the &quot;cups&quot; measurement as a scale is more accurate. </p><p>A few days later, I used the recommended amount of yeast (2 tsp), weighed out the flour (450 g to be exact) and the water. I saw that the dough was still a bit &quot;doughy&quot;, so I added an extra 20 mL of water to the batch (395 mL in total). It was too sticky to be able to knead (Fig 2, img1), yet it felt very soft and after allowing it to rise for several hours, I baked it using the dutch oven. NOTE: I was sure that it had risen well, when the dough (before baking) was very bubbly on the surface and small movements of the bowl containing the dough resulted in a &quot;jiggling&quot; of the dough surface. This time, it rose more than the previous batch (likely due to the extra yeast) and was less dense than the last batch (owing to the excess water added).</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="second batch" src="/assets/images/bread2-19d89ba343b4abe8ec1492f13ad64569.jpeg" width="1280" height="416" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 2. Batch 2: (img 1) sticky dough, (img 2) moulded dough for baking, (img 3) final product.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Without a job at this point, I wanted to bake more and change the conditions to geet the best loaf. I wondered what is the impact of leaving the dough to sit for longer? What is the impact of kneading? Surely I can google this, but I wanted to experience the feeling and taste differences. Therefore, the next batch that I made, was using the same contents as above only, I allowed the dough to sit for 3 hours at room temperature, then 2 days in the fridge (covered). The day before cooking, I pulled out the dough, moulded it into a ball and allowed it to sit covered in plastic wrap in the fridge overnight. When I baked this loaf, it rose slightly more than the last batch, and was also more porous (Fig 3). From what I understand, it seems that when you put the dough in the fridge, fermentation is slowed down to allow the development of more complex flavours.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="optimising-a-few-conditions">Optimising a few conditions<a href="#optimising-a-few-conditions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Optimising a few conditions" title="Direct link to Optimising a few conditions">​</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="third batch" src="/assets/images/bread-3-688d4025dcac098afd75278bf7cd9fd2.jpeg" width="1280" height="637" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 3.

Therefore, a dough was prepared as previous, however, it was kneaded for 5 minutes of before allowing the dough to rise. Due to the better properties of the previous batch of bread, the dough was immediately placed in the fridge, in a covered bowel. The dough was left for close to 22 hours in the fridge. The dough appeared to have similar textures as the previous batch, however, was less soft upon touching it.</p><p>The dough was moulded and scored (using tips that I got from <a href="https://vegpatchkitchen.co.uk/what-is-oven-spring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegpatchkitchen</a>) and baked from it&#x27;s cold state. The idea behind scoring is that it allows the gases to uniformly escape, making bread the rise more uniform, instead of having that weird bubble in the middle of the loaf (as seen in img 2 of Fig 3).</p><p>While the final bread loaf in Fig 4 (img 3) appears to be more uniform, without the ugly bubble in the middle, it was less porous than batch 3 (Fig 3). This was attributed to the small additions of flour that I added in order to knead the bread. As small amounts of excess flour decreases the water content, the bread ultimately became more dense. I thought this bread was the tastiest and best looking so far. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="fourth batch" src="/assets/images/bread4-c1294227c25e4d5f5ce68565394cd866.jpeg" width="1280" height="427" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 4.

First, 4 tsp of dried yeast was added to 2 cups of warm water (equivalent to 427 g of water). The yeast was allowed to grow for 5 minutes and then added to the flour/salt mixture. The mixture was combined with a wooden spoon. As it appeared to be very flaky and floury, an extra 229 g of water was added. It appeared to be very slicky and slimy. It was too sticky to be kneaded, or even handled. This large batch was left in the mixing bowl, covered and put straight into the fridge for 22 hours. </p><p>The oven was preheated to 220°C and the dutch oven was preheated for 30 minutes.

The defining features were the high porosity caused by the high water content, the uniform growth in the dough due to scoring of the loaf and the softness of the inside! </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="fifth batch" src="/assets/images/bread5-2f25c7674ba79a4c29f3031a018b639a.jpeg" width="1280" height="429" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 5.

The appearance was no different to when I put it in the freezer, however, it seemed to have less structural integrity (i.e. everytime I tried to mould it into a ball, overtime it would loss the shape). At 4.30pm, I begun preparing the oven to bake the dough. I popped it in for another half an hour bake, followed by 15 minutes without the lid.</p><p>When I pulled it out of the oven, it had a very large circumference which is consistent with the dough losing its shape. It rose a bit, but was not as inflated as previous. I suspect that some of the yeast died when it was frozen and to compensate for this, I shouldve added extra yeast to the batch. The bread was hard on the outside and soft on the inside, just like I like it. It was very porous and tasted good. I think this bread was great overall. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/bread-20240530-a16ee25a5d1ae99111d0ec6ca8cb3d77.svg" width="2406" height="784" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 6.

I attributed the poor shape to yeast dying during the freezing process. This enticed me to use more yeast this time, as I plan to freeze it. </p><p><em>Method</em>
To the yeast, add the warm water and a pinch of sugar. Wait 5-10 minutes for the yeast to foam (I love this part! It&#x27;s like I am controlling my own little world). Add all dry ingredients to a bowl. Mix around and add the water/yeast mixture. Stir through. (Note: the mixture will be very wet. That is great. The more wet or sticky it is, the more porous it will be! Although I&#x27;m not sure how freezing will affect this though) and cover for 3 hours. (Note: I put my dough in the microwave, seems to be a warm spot). </p><p>After 3 hours, I pulled the dough out of the bowl, a lightly covered with flour, being careful not to press it (i.e. knead) too much. Next, I placed it in a bread bag, allowing a little bit of air in and room for the dough to still grow and then put into the freezer where it will sit for a few days. I plan to bake it sometime next week. </p><p>Stay tuned!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h2><ol><li>Cho, I.H. and D.G.

I had just prepared a butter tofu and rice for dinner, but it was only 5 pm (we usually eat at 6 pm). As I was cleaning up, I had a desire to bake more bread. But I didn&#x27;t want to make anymore bread, especially considering that I still had a dough in the freezer! Therefore, I decided I would make puff pastry for dinner the following night. The initial recipe that I went with wanted 250 g of butter! I cut it down to 170g and added a excess of water and refrigerated for a longer period of time:</p><p align="center"> 250 g flour<br>1/4 tsp salt<br>170 g butter<br>2 cup water<br></p><p><em>extra flour for dusting</em> </p><p></p><p>So basically, I blended the flour and butter to make a crumbly consistency and then the water to create a dough. It was meant to be very crumbly, but because I added too much water, it was very sticky. I needed to compensate by adding more flour. Once the dough was very crumbly, I rolled it out into a long rectangle and then folded several times. I covered it in plastic wrap and placed in the fridge. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="preparing-and-cooking-the-triangles">Preparing and cooking the triangles<a href="#preparing-and-cooking-the-triangles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Preparing and cooking the triangles" title="Direct link to Preparing and cooking the triangles">​</a></h2><p><em>23.5.24</em> </p><p>Next, I pulled the dough out of the fridge, unwrapped it and rolled it to be a little thinner. I divided it into 6x rectangles. Note: this dough was so sticky that they definitely were not rectangles! I prepared the pastry filling as follows: </p><p align="center">1 Garlic<br>1/2 onion<br>handful of spinach<br>1 tsp bread crumbs<br>1/4 cup tasty cheese<br>1/4 cup mozarella<br>1 egg</p><p>Basically, in about 20 g of butter, I fried up garlic and onion and spinach. It was cooled slightly, then i added all the remaining ingredients and mixed well. </p><p>I then added ~1 heaped table spoon to the pastries and folded as best as I could into triangles....

However, I will do things differently next time. I will cut out more of the butter if possible and swap for a bit of olive oil oil, so that the flavour more closely resembles pizza dough, rather than biscuits. These pastries were very sweet and so I would have liked to add a bit more salt to make them go well with the savoury filling.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/cooking">cooking</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/bread">bread</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/pastry">pastry</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/my-vegetarian-cookbook">my vegetarian cookbook</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2024/05/28/2024/May">PhD update</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-05-28T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 28, 2024</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>What&#x27;s new in the life of Carly? Recently I started working as a laboratory technician for ANFF (<a href="https://anff.org.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Australian National Fabrication Facility</a>), back at the Innovation Campus in Wollongong. ANFF is a government funded organisation that is designed to support Research and Development. There are several nodes located around Australia, with several in each state. The ANFF Materials node is located here at the University of Wollongong as well as the University of Newcastle, specialising in polymers, bioinks, and electromaterials.</p><p>I have been here for 2 weeks so far. At the moment, the work is pretty slow, yet I am trying to keep busy. I have been trained on the <a href="/blog/2024/May/icp_">ICP</a> and elemental analyser and am waiting for traiing by Greg on the digestor in order to further my training on the ICP. I hope to use it a few times in order to become more familiar since I am now the official trainer for it. While I wait for things to happen here, I have continued my learning with python. In fact, today I wrote a program with the following purposes: </p><ol><li>To create a new folder with the month, then a folder with the date</li><li>To take a file and convert it from txt to csv</li><li>To extract the X and Y values from the folder and normalise the Y column. </li><li>To create a line graph of the X and normalised Y values. </li><li>To export the image as a png with the date and activity as the file name. </li></ol><p>I feel as excited about programing as I did with the synthesis of my polymers. Both of these skills have different thresholds and I think they can complement each other very nicely. I just wish I could get a mixture of lab work and desk work... As I was told today &quot;This place is very slow, as there are many changes happening..&quot;</p><p>In addition, I have been learning a bi¬t of LaTeX. It was a large hurdle and a little traumatic installing it, only for Nick to point out to me later on that Typst (which I am more fluent with) is open access for offline use (something I did not realise before). Therefore, I looked through the extensions of VSCode and found the typst extension, which I immediately installed. I began to create a template for my publications, which is much nicer than using microsoft word!!!! If I could do one thing over again, it would be to use typst for my thesis. I will definitely be using this to create reports in the future. </p><p>In other news, both of the examiners have returned my PhD thesis. I am yet to receive it, however, my supervisors have told me that there are mostly minor corrections (They didn&#x27;t want to give me too much information, and later I learned that they are not allowed to tell me anything). I&#x27;m hoping that I can correct it soon, but I am very nervous about what it will say! </p><div align="center"><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="phd revision" src="/assets/images/phd-revision-2c8dffaf22a0504d3a2f184d98aba560.PNG" width="517" height="265" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Caption: The only information I can get about my thesis at this point</em></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ph-d">PhD</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/work">work</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/python">python</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/programming">programming</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/la-te-x">LaTeX</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2024/May/gluten-intolerance">Gluten intolerance</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-05-23T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 23, 2024</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Bread is subjectively the best thing to exist on Earth. Do you agree? Well about 5-10% of you will not agree. This is because gluten intolerance is a fairly prevalent allergy. Celiac disease is the name given to a gluten intolerance, which is diagnosed in about 1% of people wordwide. People with this disease experience vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, numbness in the hands and feet among many other symptoms, in response to gluten ingestion. Why does this occur?</p><p>Celiac disease is commonly inherited through the genes. One genetic marker of celiac is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genotype. About 30% of people will express this genotype, however, only 1-3% of people will develop the disease. These two genes present on Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) to produce an immune response when exposed to peptides from Gliadin.</p><p>As I explained in my previous bread post, gluten is composed of gliadin, which is the harmful component to people with celiac. Gliadin is difficult to digest, even in healthy humans, due to the presence of prolamins (a group of plant storage proteins). These proteins are generally hydrophobic (or water-hating), with the central region composed mostly of glutamine and proline amino acids. As a result, gliaden will pass into the intestinal barrier. The presence of gliadin in the small intestine produces an inflammtory response, where cells will release tissue transamidase (tTG), often the reason why we would experience bloating in response to breads. tTg expression is increased in celliac sufferers.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/t-tg-89320866901139e2a22b9e89b7763514.jpg" width="849" height="622" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 1.

This cross-linking is an important step that leads to insoluble protein aggregates, which can be cleared from the body. However, it can also convert glutamine to glutamic acid in a process called deamidation. </p><p>Deamidation of gliadin produces negatively charged peptides at physiological pH (7.4-7.6), which then has a high affinity for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. The binding of the glutamic acid to the HLA proteins, results in T-cell stimulation, followed by release of proinflammatory cytokines. This inflammatory response leads to the destruction of the intestinal villi, which are responsible for absorbing nutrients.In addition, people with celliac disease, antibodies are produced in response to the tTG release, further invoking the limitation in gliadin digestion and thus, increasing the prevalence of inflammation. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h3><ol><li>Sha, X., et al., The prolamins, from structure, property, to the function in encapsulation and delivery of bioactive compounds.

The liquid sample is injected into a spray chamber which is converted to an aerosol via a nebuliser. During this process, only the very fine particles are injected into the inductor. In the inductor, the sample aerosol is further dried and vapourised due to the high temperatures (10000 K) in the sample carrier. In this process, all chemical bonds are broken, allowing for the vapourisation of each individual atom (Fig 2b). The free atoms collide with plasma, allowing them to transition to an excited state. Upon relaxation to ground state, the ions/atoms will emit a photon of characteristic energies, which can be used to determine the elemental origin of the ions. The total number of photons emitted is proportional to the concentration.</p><p>The ionisation plasma is typically argon gas as it is chemically inert and contains a high proportion of cations and electrons with a high electron density. In the set up shown in Fig 2a, radiofrequency (RF) is applied to a coil which produces “seed” electrons which are accelerated and collide with argon gas to form argon plasma and electrons:</p><p align="center"> Ar(g) → Ar<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-sample-preparation">About sample preparation<a href="#about-sample-preparation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to About sample preparation" title="Direct link to About sample preparation">​</a></h2><p>Solubilised solutions (aqueous or organic) are required to perform ICP analysis. Therefore, samples (&lt;0.2 %&gt;) are typically treated with nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) or HCl, in a process referred to as &quot;acid digestion&quot;.  Sample concentrations of &lt;0.2% are crucial to avoid any matrix effects.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="matrix-effects">Matrix effects<a href="#matrix-effects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Matrix effects" title="Direct link to Matrix effects">​</a></h2><p>Matrix effects are interferences in the analysis due ton signal dift caused by the deposition of solids on the sample apertures or signal suppression caused by salt ions. The typical salt interference is caused by oxide formation, which seems to reduce the ion flow and promotes clogging at the sample cone (the interface that analyses ion extraction). With years of research, matrix effects have typically solved through the use of OES compared to MS. ICP-OES relies on photon emission rather than ion acceleration, which makes it less susceptible to interferences. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advantages-of-icp-compared-to-other-elemental-analyses">Advantages of ICP compared to other elemental analyses<a href="#advantages-of-icp-compared-to-other-elemental-analyses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advantages of ICP compared to other elemental analyses" title="Direct link to Advantages of ICP compared to other elemental analyses">​</a></h2><p>As ICP heats to very high temperatures, samples undergo more efficient vaporisation, atomisation and excitation. This allows for a wider range of elements to be analysed by ICP. In addition, the high temperature means that there is less water vapour present, in turn reducing the concentration of oxygen species and thus a lower level of matrix interferences caused by oxide formation. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h2><ol><li>Ammann, A.A., Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS): a versatile tool.
