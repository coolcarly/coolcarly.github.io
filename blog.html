I thought I had a bit of time to relax before they sent it back, and during that time I was planning to write a paper. I was shocked when one of my supervisors sent it back within a fortnight! It was so quick and I was so happy. Last week, I also sent a manuscript around for review, which we were going to discuss at last Thursday&#x27;s meeting (9 Nov 2023). </p><p>Now before I tell you how the meeting went, I need to give you some context on my Thursday meetings. </p><p>Every Thursday for the past 4 years, I have met with my supervisors to discuss my work. There is one particular supervisor who made me feel like crap every week - putting me down and telling me that my work wasn&#x27;t very good. I would often cry and be so deflated for the rest of the week. In hinesight, I should&#x27;ve realised that I wasn&#x27;t being attacked personally... but it&#x27;s difficult to reason like that when my biggest insecurity is my intelligence. Therefore, I stopped sharing a lot of the new and creative things that I was trying in the lab because I didn&#x27;t want to feel bad anymore. That&#x27;s also the reason that I never wrote any manuscripts, because she made me feel so bad about myself that I was convinced my work wasn&#x27;t very good. </p><p>Last Thursday, I had a meeting with all of my supervisors about a manuscript that I wrote. Prior to the meeting, I told myself &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter what happens, or what they think about it, because after I finish my PhD, I am going to find a job away from academia.&quot; I tried so hard to be strong. However, during the meeting, I was put down about my experiments and basically told that it was not very good by that particular supervisor that has always made me feel crap throughout my PhD. </p><p>Afterwards, I went home and cried for the rest of the day. I was panicking that I was totally worthless and had no skills. I was so concerned that I had wasted 4 years of my life with nothing to show for it. On Friday (10 Nov), I had a mid-day nap. During this nap, I dreamed that I was in a meeting with my three supervisors and calmly, they told me that my PhD was crap and that we should consider downgrading to a masters degree. </p><p>Once I woke up from this nightmare, I went into freak-out mode. My mind was constantly thinking &quot;I&#x27;ve just wasted 4 years of my life... 4 years where I could have done anything else, built up other skills or started a career and earned/saved money.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m never going to amount to anything.&quot;</p><p>These thoughts still elude my mind. It&#x27;s probably the reason that I lost my vision yesterday as a result of a migraine. </p><p>However, I just need to remind myself that it will be over soon and I will be so happy with the final product.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/10/31/2023-10">Updates</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-10-31T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">October 31, 2023</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Over the weekend, Nick and I headed to the <a href="/life/trips/hunter-valley">Hunter Valley</a> for a wedding.

Both Pawel and David agreed that I should not be doing anymore lab work and just focus on writing my thesis! There it is &quot;only focus on writing&quot;. </p><p><em>Productivity:</em> From Friday onwards, I started writing all my results down. I wrote a lot in the span of 4 days and I felt that if I kept writing then I could be finished by the end of the month. </p><p><em>Unproductive:</em> On Wednesday 23 August, I had a really bad day of writing. By 3 pm, I was on the lounge watching a TV show. I did not attempt to recommence writing for the rest of the evening. It really messed me around on Thursday. At this rate, I won&#x27;t finish my PhD in time!</p><p><em>A tip to improve productivity:</em> I was lucky this week in my Thursday meeting. I got a few tips from my supervisors about writing. David commented that the best thing to do when you are not feeling like thinking is to write out the methods chapter. He was right. Writing out my methods chapter is a simple way to get myself in the mood of writing and to continue my writing routine. </p><p><em>More unproductivity:</em> This morning, I went driving around Wollongong to try and get a quote to fix my passenger-side mirror of my car. Grant from Fernhill Smash Repairs told me that he would be in touch later in the afternoon. NOTE: the passenger side-mirror is no longer afixed to the car as I nipped it off on the way home from the beach yesterday. Without a passenger side-mirror, I cannot drive my car. This means that I can&#x27;t drive to North Wollongong beach! I need to paddle in the morning for me to feel fresh for a day of writing! This screwed up my whole day. At 10 am, I gave up on writing and decided to head to Innovation Campus to get some data off the computers. I ran there and remained until 4 pm..... and that is all I did today.</p><p>In the evening, Nick and I walked to <a href="/life/food-and-drink/craft-beer/illawarra/barrel-shephard">The Barrel Shephard</a> for dinner and drinks. I felt aweful, like I didn&#x27;t deserve to be going out after a day of very little work and progress. Note to future self: stop going into the lab, save it for the weekend or afternoons.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/08/08/2023-08">A very stupid thing</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-08-08T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 8, 2023</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>When I woke up at 5.55 am, it seemed like it was going to be another cracker of a day. I prepared for teaching, went for a run, did some stretching and showered all before 8.30 am. I was more than ready to make huge progress today! </p><p>I arrived at work at 9 am and from the minute I began to do things in the lab, everything went wrong. I couldn&#x27;t get any good data. Around 10 am, I went to get help to fix a cable for my potentiostat (as the wires lost connection to reduce the signal). However, I was unsuccessful in getting help. A colleague/researcher said to meet her at 3 pm to repair the cable; but I couldnt wait this long as I was due to teach at 1.30 til 4.30 pm (Week 3 of Semester 2).. </p><p>By this point it was 11 am - I was feeling really tired and unmotivated. </p><p>My first thought was to go home. I lost motivation when I realised that I would only be home for 1 hour before having to leave again. Instead, I pulled out my soft back warmer from my draw and used it as a pillow. I put my head down on the desk and had an hour nap. </p><p>I woke up less tired than before, but really groggy. I packed my safety glasses and water bottle into my handbag and walked towards my car, then drove to the main campus. Travel between the innovation campus and the main campus is really tedious and it is often difficult to find parking in the middle of the day. </p><p>I was parked and ready to get out of the car at 1 pm. I walked towards Panzinis, a cafe located in front of the UOW library. I go here for coffee because they offer staff discounts and I love discouts! I ordered my coffee and it was made within 5 minutes. It was a rather pleasant experience - too bad that I was not in a good mood. </p><p>The undergraduate chemistry labs are located in building 21 on level 3. I headed here after I was handed my coffee - but I was at least 20 minutes early. When I walked into the lab, it was empty abar one demonstrator - Sue. I chatted for less than a minute before rereading over my emails that said I was only rostered for Week 9. In sheer disbelief, I spent a few minutes researching my emails and was convinced that I showed up for no reason! In embarrassment, I left and drove to North Wollongong beach. &quot;Wow&quot; I thought. &quot;How stupid&quot;. &quot;Why didn&#x27;t I read my emails?&quot; </p><p>I was pretty relieved though, because I didn&#x27;t really want to teach. I don&#x27;t need the extra funds that bad and it&#x27;s not worth taking time away from my writing. Excited that I could fix the potentiostat, I also sent an email to a colleague, indicating my error and that I would be there at 3 pm. </p><p>Just as I was about to get out of my car and go for a dip in the ocean to calm down my anxiety and embarrassment, I received an email from Giel (the subject coordinator) who asked me to come back because I was rostered to work. Can you believe how embarrassed I was after this? It took me 15 minutes to return, park and walk to the labs. I quickly walked into the service room, dodging the lines of students waiting to collect a pH probe for their experiment. I threw on a red lab coat, my safety glasses and grabbed a pen. </p><p>I apologised several times to Giel and I literally felt like slapping my forehead because it was such a stupid thing that happened. The worst thing though, was sending a third email to my colleague telling her that I was wrong and I was meant to teach! </p><p>The labs were very slow and very basic. The students were working on acid-base titrations. In that moment, I thought that it wasn&#x27;t too bad. I actually enjoyed it.  I&#x27;m just glad that I don&#x27;t have to teach all the time. The labs ended at 4.30 pm. I drove straight home and relaxed until dinner time. </p><p>I honestly feel like I wasted the whole day.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/08/04/2023-08">Rewarding myself</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-08-04T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 4, 2023</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Lately, I have been freaking out with the amount of work still left in my PhD. Today, I had planned to have a writing day but I realised as I opened various thesis chapters, that I have actually written a lot! At 11 am, I decided to head into the lab to try to resynthesise a monomer for my second research chapter. While searching the freezer for my materials, I came across a molecule that I had synthesised previously, but never used. It was a dibromo-compound that was initially synthesised for a grignard reaction. </p><p>For fun, I set up a 1 mL (200 mg) scale <a href="/science/polymer-science/synthesis/darp">direct arylation polymerisation</a>. For the rest of the day, I felt so happy and accomplished. I feel so excited to work this polymer up and characterise it. </p><p>To hear more about this, and see the fun I have with these reactions, visit <a href="/phd/side-projects">side projects</a>. </p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/dhap-461e005e73beee5a4a5377372feae3c5.jpeg" width="60%" class="centered-image img_ev3q"></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/08/02/2023-08">Garlic &amp; Rosemary Pull apart bread</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-08-02T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 2, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It&#x27;s already August! Wow, where has the time gone? Five months left until I need to submit my PhD thesis. </p><p>I arrived home from work after an unsuccessful day in the lab. The electrodes attached to my potentiostat were disfunctioning. I spent my 3 hours of lab time, trying to trouble shoot the problem. With the help of one of the guys in the workshop, I was able to fix the electrode. However, upon a &quot;dummy test&quot;, the signal was not strong. I gave up, and decided to go home and not waste anymore time. </p><p>I arrived home and prepared a quiche for dinner. I was feeling inspired by Emma (as over the weekend, she made a really awesome scrambled eggs). The egg filling alone contained some butter and rosemary. </p><p>After I finished preparing dinner, I was still in the mood to cook - anything to avoid working on my thesis! I decided to prepare tomorrow nights dinner as well. </p><p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I get tired of eating similar things all the time. I feel like it is super boring and not creative at all. While I was having these thoughts, I had finished the rest of our loaf of bread. That&#x27;s when I was inspired to make some bread. </p><p>I remember when I was much younger, around 15 years old and would often bake various things for my family. I enjoyed baking a lot - from bread to cakes. However, I saw so many people around me who were a lot better. I often compared myself to others and it really demotivated me to cook (Yes, I always wanted to be the best). I wonder what life would have been like if I didn&#x27;t compare myself and just did the things that I enjoyed - because I enjoyed them. </p><p>Maybe my enjoyment of baking and &quot;creative cooking&quot; is the reason that I chose chemistry. I always wonder what drove me to stay in chemistry. I usually say that it was because I got the best marks for the least amount of effort - which is probably true. Now, I am thinking that it was also because I was using my hands to create something. Synthesis is very similar to cooking: a step by step process to create something wonderful. </p><p>The funny thing is though, I struggle so much to follow recipes. The same thing applies in the lab: I struggle a lot to follow new synthetic protocols. This caused so much stress during my undergrad: as I didn&#x27;t perform as well as some of the other students. Somehow I have made it through and am almost finished a PhD in chemistry! Sometimes I forget how amazing it is that I&#x27;ve made it this far. Dani had to remind me earlier today when we were discussing my PhD. </p><p>Anyway, the <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/rosemary-garlic-pull-apart-bread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garlic &amp; Rosemary pull apart bread</a> that I made was taken from Sally&#x27;s baking addiction. There is some good stuff on her blog! I also listed the procedure that I used (because I never follow a procedure well and there are always things that I modify or change) in my <a href="/life/food-and-drink/cooking/pull-apart-bread">Pull-apart bread</a> post. </p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/garlic-rosemary-bread-22e55f4fb8219f5ec83cee62fce49026.jpeg" width="50%" class="centered-image img_ev3q"></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/life">Life</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/science">Science</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/phd">PhD</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 Carly Baker.</div></div></div></footer></div>
