In order to prepare a sourdough starter, I needed 1 week where I wasn&#x27;t going to be away from home. After the <a href="/blog/2024/June/mudge-24">Mudgee</a> weekend, I decided that this week would be a perfect opportunity to get the starter up and running. What do I mean by a sourdough starter? I mean to grow the bacteria necessary to craft sourdough bread. </p><p>I started with the following equipment/ingredients: </p><ul><li>Rye flour*</li><li>tap water**</li><li>2 x 500 g jars</li><li>food scale</li></ul><p>Note: I chose rye flour as the starting flour because it is meant to have a higher level of good bacteria.
Note: Some say that you should use bottled water for the initial week (because chlorine is not present). I filled a drink bottle and left it overnight. By doing this, the chlorine dissapates from the water. You could also use boiled water (cooled down of course).</p><p>The ideal environment is 24–28 °C. As it is winter, sometimes I used warmer water (30°C) and wrapped it in a towel to warm it up. </p><p>Here I have listed the method that I used to create my sourdough starter. It is still young at the moment and I have not yet baked bread with it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1-friday-14-june-2024"><em>Day 1, Friday 14 June 2024</em><a href="#day-1-friday-14-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-1-friday-14-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-1-friday-14-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>First, I weighed out my jar. Next, I measured 20 g of rye flour and 30 g of water and combined. The mixture was as viscous as a &quot;thick pancake batter.&quot; The jar was covered with a breathable lid (in my case, paper towl) and left to sit at room temperature for 24 hours. Note here that the temperature will determine the speed at which the bacteria will grow. At the moment, it is winter so the temperatures will be max 20 °C. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-2-saturday-15-june-2024"><em>Day 2, Saturday 15 June 2024</em><a href="#day-2-saturday-15-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-2-saturday-15-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-2-saturday-15-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>I repeated the process. I added 20g of rye flour and 30 g of water, mixed to combine so it appeared as a &quot;thick pancake batter&quot;, covered and let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-3-sunday-16-june-2024"><em>Day 3, Sunday 16 June 2024</em><a href="#day-3-sunday-16-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-3-sunday-16-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-3-sunday-16-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>I repeated the process: 20 g of rye flour and 30 g of water, mixed to combine so it appeared as a &quot;thick pancake batter&quot;, covered and let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours. At this stage, the starter was beginning to smell very sour, almost like our food bin/compost bin. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-4-monday-17-june-2024"><em>Day 4 Monday 17 June 2024</em><a href="#day-4-monday-17-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-4-monday-17-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-4-monday-17-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>When I lifted the paper towel from the container, I observed small bubbles which is indicative of gases forming and thus carbon dioxide. I emptied half of the contents into a new container and discarded the rest. Then I repeated the process from yesterday: 20 g of rye flour and 25 g of water. Note: I used less water this time, because that was enough to form a thick paste with consistency similar to yesterday. I made note of the temperature of the room, which was 18.5 °C. </p><p>After covering the glass jar, again with a breathable cover - in this case paper towel, I then put a rubber band around the jar to mark the level of the yeast. This time, I left it to sit for 14 hours at room temperature. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-5-tuesday-18-june-2024"><em>Day 5 Tuesday 18 June 2024</em><a href="#day-5-tuesday-18-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-5-tuesday-18-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-5-tuesday-18-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>At 6 am (when I woke up), I opened the jar and I could see that the bubbles were slightly larger than yesterday. The flour mixture was increasing it&#x27;s sour odour. I stirred the flour mixture and allowed it to sit until I returned home from work. </p><p>At 4.30 pm, I opened the jar ready to feed it. I could not really make out a difference from yesterday. I scooped half of the mixture out (47 g to be exact) and put it in a fresh container. For some reason, I added the 20 g flour and 30 g water to the old container. I guess I was in autopilot mode. Nontheless, I mixed it and then covered again. I observed that some bubbles began to form once I left it for a few hours. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-6-wednesday-19-june-2024"><em>Day 6 Wednesday 19 June 2024</em><a href="#day-6-wednesday-19-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-6-wednesday-19-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-6-wednesday-19-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>I checked the sourdough again this morning. The temperature was 16.7 °C. There were no bubbles present. I gave it a stir once again and left it to sit for the rest of the day. </p><p>It is unusual that there was no activity. There could be many reasons for this. Perhaps that the temperature is so cold. Therefore, I wrapped the container in a tea towel to assist in warming up the jar. </p><p>At the usual time of 4.30 pm, I halved the starter (31 g) and fed the starter more flour (30 g) and water (53 g). </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-7-thursday-20-june-2024"><em>Day 7 Thursday 20 June 2024</em><a href="#day-7-thursday-20-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-7-thursday-20-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-7-thursday-20-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>The starter appeared to grow slightly when I checked it this morning. As the last few days, I gave it a stir and added a little bit of water (10 g). In the afternoon, I halved the mixture (33 g starter) and fed it with 30 g rye flour and 54 g of water.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-8-friday-21-june-2024"><em>Day 8 Friday 21 June 2024</em><a href="#day-8-friday-21-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-8-friday-21-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-8-friday-21-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>At this point, I was convinced that the yeast was alive. Just before I was going to feed the starter, I did a &quot;float test&quot; of the dough to show that gases were present. In a float test, a small amount of starter is placed into water and if it floats, it means that it the starter is active (but does not necessarily mean that it is ready). </p><p>Now, I decided to increase the feed content of the starter. I took 22 g of the starter and fed it with 40 g of flour and 99 g of water. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-9-saturday-22-june-2024"><em>Day 9 Saturday 22 June 2024</em><a href="#day-9-saturday-22-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-9-saturday-22-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-9-saturday-22-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>Again, when I checked the sourdough starter (at 7 am), it was very foamy but did not appear to rise. However, while we were out during the day, I placed the starter into the warm-ish oven (it was no hotter than 30 degrees). When I returned home, the starter was more bubbly than before and it grew by about 60%. I suspect that 4 hours in a warm oven helped the bacteria to grow.</p><p>At 4.30 pm, I weighed 22 g of the mixture into a fresh jar and fed it with 45 g of rye flour and 75 g water.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-10-sunday-23-june-2024"><em>Day 10 Sunday 23 June 2024</em><a href="#day-10-sunday-23-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-10-sunday-23-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-10-sunday-23-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>When I checked the starter at 8 am, I saw that the starter grew almost to double it&#x27;s size. How exciting! By 4 pm, the starter appeared more active and grew a little more. </p><p>In a fresh jar, I weighed 20 g of starter, added 40 g of rye flour and 84 g water. With the left over discard, I made banana pancakes ! They were very tasty and fluffy too. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-11-monday-24-june-2024"><em>Day 11 Monday 24 June 2024</em><a href="#day-11-monday-24-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-11-monday-24-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-11-monday-24-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>I checked the starter at 6 am and I saw that the starter grew slightly but it seemed to collapse by 4 pm. It looks like it is ready to bake. I just need to get my timing right. Once again, in a fresh jarr, I weighed 16 g of starter, 47 g flour and 99 g water. It was more watery than usual (I wanted to know if it wasn&#x27;t rising because of the water content). The discard was placed in a fresh container and left in the fridge for 2 days (I made pastry with it later on).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-12-tuesday-25-june-2024"><em>Day 12 Tuesday 25 June 2024</em><a href="#day-12-tuesday-25-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-12-tuesday-25-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-12-tuesday-25-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>In the morning, the starter appeared to rise (not double it&#x27;s size, but by 50%), but once again by 4 pm - it shrunk. </p><p>I repeated the procedure. I weighed 16 g of starter in a fresh jar, and fed it with 50 g of flour and 82 g of water. With this discard, I made <a href="/blog/2024/June/sourdough-pancakes">pancakes</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-13-wednesday-26-june-2024"><em>Day 13 Wednesday 26 June 2024</em><a href="#day-13-wednesday-26-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-13-wednesday-26-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-13-wednesday-26-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>By 8 am, it grew as per yesterday. This time, I wanted to see if feeding it would sustain the yeast for a little longer. Therefore, at 8 am, I added 13 g of flour and 17 g of water. Over the day, it grew but not a lot. At 8 pm, I watched the starter and it looked like it was breathing with gas bubbles popping occasionally. I left the sourdough starter to sit overnight. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-14-thursday-27-june-2024"><em>Day 14 Thursday 27 June 2024</em><a href="#day-14-thursday-27-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-14-thursday-27-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-14-thursday-27-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>At 6 am, I saw that the sourdough starter had deflated since last night. There&#x27;s no wonder considering that I did not feed it yesterday. As usual, I weighed out 22 g of starter and fed it with 40 g of flour and 64 g of water. The reason for using more starter this time, is that I am worried that the yeast is not strong enough yet. </p><p>At 5 pm, I observed that the sourdough did not grow a lot. Maybe 20%? I know it is alive and well, I am not sure what is wrong. Therefore, just before I went to bed, I placed it in the warm-ish oven. I suspect that when I did that on Saturday, it grew a lot. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-15-friday-28-june-2024"><em>Day 15 Friday 28 June 2024</em><a href="#day-15-friday-28-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-15-friday-28-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-15-friday-28-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>I suspected right, because at 5.55 am I observed that the starter deflated (based on the marks on the jar). In a seperate jar, I fed 24 g of starter with 50 g of flour and 80 g of water. On this day, I came home from work at 2 pm. I saw that the starter had risen and as I watched it over the rest of the day, I saw that it began to deflate at 3 pm. So I&#x27;ve figured out that it is 9 hours. </p><p>At 8.10 pm, I went to feed the starter to get my timing right. However, I did not have a clean jar present. Therefore, I emptied half of my starter (I put it in the fridge) and fed with 45 g of flour and 88 g of water. I placed the covered jar in the oven over night. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-16-saturday-29-june-2024"><em>Day 16 Saturday 29 June 2024</em><a href="#day-16-saturday-29-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-16-saturday-29-june-2024" title="Direct link to day-16-saturday-29-june-2024">​</a></h2><p>At 7.30 am, I checked the starter and I saw once again that it deflated. No suprise since I left it for 11 hours. In addition, I did a float test and observed that the starter sunk to the bottom of the cup. Now, it was 7.30 am and I wanted to try baking today! Therefore, once again, in a clean jar, I took 24 g of starter and fed with 55 g of water. I placed in the oven (30 degrees). The discard was kept in the same jar (which I planned to feed later in the day to keep). At 10am, I checked the sourdough starter and no bubbles were forming. I gave it a vigorous mix which produced air bubbles, and more began to form. At 12.45 pm, the starter passed the float test. </p><p>At 1.30 pm, I used the entirety of the sourdough (that was fed in the morning) to prepare a loaf of sourdough bread.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="outlook">Outlook:<a href="#outlook" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Outlook:" title="Direct link to Outlook:">​</a></h2><ul><li>Since Day 1, the temperature has been average of 18.2 ± 1.2 (see Figure 1 below), with some days the dough being placed in a warmish area than room temperature.

Note about the starter: This was a disguard that I kept in the fridge for 2 days. I think it is safe to leave sourdough disguard for 3 days in the fridge, so I wanted to use it before I needed to throw it away. </p><p>NOTE about the hydration: on the 26.06.24: before I added the starter, I added 1/2 cup of water (which I realised was a mistake therefore this recipe is tweaked). After I added the starter, it was very sticky! This was wrong, the consistency should be crumbly. Therefore, it is crucial to add the sourdough starter before extra water, so you correct the consistency. </p><p>Note for step 8: Refrigeration is important for pastry. The colder it is, the better. You want the butter and oil to solidify to bring the crumbly consistency to your pastry. I also think that it will aid in bring flavours out of the sourdough.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/cooking">cooking</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/my-vegetarian-cookbook">my vegetarian cookbook</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/sourdough-starter">sourdough starter</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/sourdough-discard">sourdough discard</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/pancakes">pancakes</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2024/June/sourdough-pancakes">Sourdough Pancakes</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-06-23T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 23, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>On 23.6.24, I used my sourdough discard for the first time.

In the presence of water, they will self-assemble to form gluten (Fig 1), which is a result of the molecule preventing the hydrophobic regions from interacting with water. Prior to the addition of water, glutenin exists as a colloid. Upon addition of water to the flour, the chains are allowed to stretch, seperate, and form new disulfide linkages. These disulfide linkages create a network of glutenin polymer that produces the strength and elasticity of bread dough. At the same time, the smaller gliadin proteins will disperse through the glutenin polymer network, which allows the bread to &quot;rise&quot;. It is the constituent that facilitates formation of the gluten network. Due to it&#x27;s self-assembling properties (as it is highly hydrophobic), it will associate into spherical particles and absorb other nutrients such as vitamin E. Thus, the quality of the gluten network that forms is dependent on the type of flour that is used.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Schematic of gluten formation" src="/assets/images/bread_schematic-2d7f68f1f1f8c5e36c0a766763aedc22.jpeg" width="1280" height="453" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 1. Schematic of gluten formation</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Mixing and kneading of the flour/water mixture encourages the gluten network to further develop. During this process, carbon dioxide is incorporated, producing a more porous dough once it is baked. Yet, we dont want the gluten networks to be so strong that they become chewy and tough. This is the reason that people turn to a &quot;no-knead&quot; method. Sometimes, a high water content is enough to facilitate formation of strong gluten networks. </p><p>Yet, there is one more ingredient that is required to create the gluten network... and that is salt. As mentioned in the <a href="/science/salt">&quot;salting-out&quot;</a> post, salt helps to decrease the water content. In this instance, salt will remove water from the protein/polymer network to increase the strength and elasicity. </p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="making-the-initial-loaf">Making the initial loaf<a href="#making-the-initial-loaf" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Making the initial loaf" title="Direct link to Making the initial loaf">​</a></h2><p>The initial recipe that I started with came from Nagi: <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-yeast-bread-recipe-no-knead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RecipeTinEats</a>. The ingredients required were:</p><p align="center"> 450 g flour <br> 2 tsp yeast <br> 2 tsp salt <br> 375 mL of warm watern (~40 °C) </p><p>First, I started off with a &quot;no kneading&quot; approach to bread making. I was unsure of the measurements for the yeast. I had the large container of active yeast as well as the packets. I initially used the packets, and with a quick google search I saw that 7 g was an equivalent of 2 tsp of yeast. Therefore, in my first attempt to make this bread, I activated one packet of the yeast in warm water. The bread was left for a few hours in a warm-ish environment to rise, and then it was moulded into a round ball and baked using the dutch oven.</p><p>After baking, the bread was very tough to cut and very dense, but it was still quite tasty and full of flavour. These bread flavours arise from fermentation. The high density is possibly attributed to a low water content. Thus, for the subsequent loaves, I went for weighing out the ingredients using a scale instead of the &quot;cups&quot; measurement as a scale is more accurate. </p><p>A few days later, I used the recommended amount of yeast (2 tsp), weighed out the flour (450 g to be exact) and the water. I saw that the dough was still a bit &quot;doughy&quot;, so I added an extra 20 mL of water to the batch (395 mL in total). It was too sticky to be able to knead (Fig 2, img1), yet it felt very soft and after allowing it to rise for several hours, I baked it using the dutch oven. NOTE: I was sure that it had risen well, when the dough (before baking) was very bubbly on the surface and small movements of the bowl containing the dough resulted in a &quot;jiggling&quot; of the dough surface. This time, it rose more than the previous batch (likely due to the extra yeast) and was less dense than the last batch (owing to the excess water added).</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="second batch" src="/assets/images/bread2-19d89ba343b4abe8ec1492f13ad64569.jpeg" width="1280" height="416" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 2.

I wondered what is the impact of leaving the dough to sit for longer? What is the impact of kneading? Surely I can google this, but I wanted to experience the feeling and taste differences. Therefore, the next batch that I made, was using the same contents as above only, I allowed the dough to sit for 3 hours at room temperature, then 2 days in the fridge (covered). The day before cooking, I pulled out the dough, moulded it into a ball and allowed it to sit covered in plastic wrap in the fridge overnight. When I baked this loaf, it rose slightly more than the last batch, and was also more porous (Fig 3). From what I understand, it seems that when you put the dough in the fridge, fermentation is slowed down to allow the development of more complex flavours.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="optimising-a-few-conditions">Optimising a few conditions<a href="#optimising-a-few-conditions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Optimising a few conditions" title="Direct link to Optimising a few conditions">​</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="third batch" src="/assets/images/bread-3-688d4025dcac098afd75278bf7cd9fd2.jpeg" width="1280" height="637" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 3.

Therefore, a dough was prepared as previous, however, it was kneaded for 5 minutes of before allowing the dough to rise. Due to the better properties of the previous batch of bread, the dough was immediately placed in the fridge, in a covered bowel. The dough was left for close to 22 hours in the fridge. The dough appeared to have similar textures as the previous batch, however, was less soft upon touching it.</p><p>The dough was moulded and scored (using tips that I got from <a href="https://vegpatchkitchen.co.uk/what-is-oven-spring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegpatchkitchen</a>) and baked from it&#x27;s cold state. The idea behind scoring is that it allows the gases to uniformly escape, making bread the rise more uniform, instead of having that weird bubble in the middle of the loaf (as seen in img 2 of Fig 3).</p><p>While the final bread loaf in Fig 4 (img 3) appears to be more uniform, without the ugly bubble in the middle, it was less porous than batch 3 (Fig 3). This was attributed to the small additions of flour that I added in order to knead the bread. As small amounts of excess flour decreases the water content, the bread ultimately became more dense. I thought this bread was the tastiest and best looking so far. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="fourth batch" src="/assets/images/bread4-c1294227c25e4d5f5ce68565394cd866.jpeg" width="1280" height="427" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Fig 4.

I allowed it to sit in the fridge while it defrosted. The appearance was no different to when I put it in the freezer, however, it seemed to have less structural integrity (i.e. everytime I tried to mould it into a ball, overtime it would loss the shape). At 4.30pm, I begun preparing the oven to bake the dough. I popped it in for another half an hour bake, followed by 15 minutes without the lid.</p><p>When I pulled it out of the oven, it had a very large circumference which is consistent with the dough losing its shape. It rose a bit, but was not as inflated as previous. I suspect that some of the yeast died when it was frozen and to compensate for this, I shouldve added extra yeast to the batch. The bread was hard on the outside and soft on the inside, just like I like it. It was very porous and tasted good.

To the yeast, add the warm water and a pinch of sugar. Wait 5-10 minutes for the yeast to foam (I love this part! It&#x27;s like I am controlling my own little world). Add all dry ingredients to a bowl. Mix around and add the water/yeast mixture. Stir through. (Note: the mixture will be very wet. That is great.

(Note: I put my dough in the microwave, seems to be a warm spot). </p><p>After 3 hours, I pulled the dough out of the bowl, a lightly covered with flour, being careful not to press it (i.e. knead) too much. Next, I placed it in a bread bag, allowing a little bit of air in and room for the dough to still grow and then put into the freezer where it will sit for a few days.

The dough was very sticky and hydrated!</li><li>The mixing bowl was covered and left and placed in the fridge for 36 hours. (note: by putting it in the fridge it slows the fermentation process. I think it was perfect at about 24 hours.)</li><li>The dutch oven was preheated to 220 °C for 30 minutes</li><li>The dough was taken from the fridge and folded a few times (with a little bit of spared flour for working). I believe this is a crucial step to ensure that the bread is porous but not too porous. </li><li>The dough was placed in the dutch oven (using baking paper to transfer) and cooked for 30 minutes with the lid on, then 10 minutes with the lid off. </li><li>The bread was allowed to cool for 10 minutes before we had it for breakfast! 😊</li></ol><p>The bread was so soft! Unlike the other loaves that I made, this one was very easy to cut through. It was so soft in the mouth and had a different flavour to it. I&#x27;m not sure if the flavour was because there was a lower flour to yeast ratio, or due to the Soy flour, but it was definitely tasty and slightly sweeter than usual. It should also be noted that previous studies with soy flour have indicated that 10% incorporation is best for the texture and flavour of bread. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/bread6-fef781444b4ed95da22d6da3ee6d0fe2.jpeg" width="1280" height="356" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: Bread made with 16% soy flour</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you can see from the images, the crumb of soy flour is slightly browner than previous loaves, with the crust being more golden. Soy bean itself is hydrophillic (water-loving) compared to wheat-flour which is water-hating. In bread recipes using 100% wheat flour, the hydrophobic associations (forms of non-covalent bonds, or interactions between molecules) between the gluten network make the bread quite tough. On the other hand, as soy flour is hydrophillic, it is more effective at absorbing water, which means that by incorporating soy flour into the dough, you will retain a higher level of water during the baking process. The proteins in soy will interact with water, and as the water evaporates, the bonds are less tough and therefore the bread will be softer.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h2><ol><li>Cho, I.H. and D.G.

What&#x27;s new in the life of Carly? Recently I started working as a laboratory technician for ANFF (<a href="https://anff.org.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Australian National Fabrication Facility</a>), back at the Innovation Campus in Wollongong. ANFF is a government funded organisation that is designed to support Research and Development. There are several nodes located around Australia, with several in each state. The ANFF Materials node is located here at the University of Wollongong as well as the University of Newcastle, specialising in polymers, bioinks, and electromaterials.</p><p>I have been here for 2 weeks so far. At the moment, the work is pretty slow, yet I am trying to keep busy. I have been trained on the <a href="/blog/2024/May/icp_">ICP</a> and elemental analyser and am waiting for traiing by Greg on the digestor in order to further my training on the ICP. I hope to use it a few times in order to become more familiar since I am now the official trainer for it. While I wait for things to happen here, I have continued my learning with python. In fact, today I wrote a program with the following purposes: </p><ol><li>To create a new folder with the month, then a folder with the date</li><li>To take a file and convert it from txt to csv</li><li>To extract the X and Y values from the folder and normalise the Y column. </li><li>To create a line graph of the X and normalised Y values. </li><li>To export the image as a png with the date and activity as the file name. </li></ol><p>I feel as excited about programing as I did with the synthesis of my polymers. Both of these skills have different thresholds and I think they can complement each other very nicely. I just wish I could get a mixture of lab work and desk work... As I was told today &quot;This place is very slow, as there are many changes happening..&quot;</p><p>In addition, I have been learning a bi¬t of LaTeX. It was a large hurdle and a little traumatic installing it, only for Nick to point out to me later on that Typst (which I am more fluent with) is open access for offline use (something I did not realise before). Therefore, I looked through the extensions of VSCode and found the typst extension, which I immediately installed. I began to create a template for my publications, which is much nicer than using microsoft word!!!! If I could do one thing over again, it would be to use typst for my thesis. I will definitely be using this to create reports in the future. </p><p>In other news, both of the examiners have returned my PhD thesis. I am yet to receive it, however, my supervisors have told me that there are mostly minor corrections (They didn&#x27;t want to give me too much information, and later I learned that they are not allowed to tell me anything). I&#x27;m hoping that I can correct it soon, but I am very nervous about what it will say! </p><div align="center"><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="phd revision" src="/assets/images/phd-revision-2c8dffaf22a0504d3a2f184d98aba560.PNG" width="517" height="265" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Caption: The only information I can get about my thesis at this point</em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><em>Date: 13.06.24</em> <br>
On Friday, 7 June 2024 at 8:57 AM, I received an email from the Graduate Research School with my thesis examination. My PhD will be awarded, pending minor changes to the thesis. This is probably the best result that I could hope for.</p><p>As I read the examiners reports, I was at first shocked and overwhelmed by the reports, however, as I read on, I realised that it was very positive, with only grammatical errors and mistakes. I ended up fixing my thesis within a day. </p><p>One of my reviewers said &quot;The number of experiments performed was really impressive, even if part of them were unsuccessful and did not lead to the desired product.&quot; The other said &quot;In summary, this is an excellent thesis and I recommend that the candidate be awarded a PhD degree.&quot; This made me feel really good about it. While I didn&#x27;t get a commended thesis, I am glad that the reviews were positive. </p><p><em>Date: 17.06.24</em> <br>
On Thursday 13 June 2024, I met with my PhD supervisors and discussed my thesis. They were happy with the changes that I made and gave me a few additional suggestions. The next day, I sent an email to the head of postgraduate studies asking if he was happy with my corrections. After consulting with my supervisors, he then sent an email to the graduate research school approving my final submission. At 10:15 am today, I submitted the final version of my thesis!!! I am proud of the work I did and while I haven&#x27;t published any manuscripts (yet hopefully), I believe I added something novel to the literature.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ph-d">PhD</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/work">work</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/thesis-corrections">thesis corrections</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/python">python</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/programming">programming</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/la-te-x">LaTeX</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2024/June/tempeh">Preparing tempeh</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-06-16T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 16, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>For dinner tonight, I wanted to prepare a couple of Greek Gyros, inspired by <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/greek-chicken-gyros-with-tzatziki/#wprm-recipe-container-21826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recipetineats</a>. Tofu was an option to use as the main protein content, however, tofu is very soft and wouldn&#x27;t go well with a wrap of this sort (to my opinion). Therefore, tempeh was the next best thing.</p><p>Previously, I attempted to cook tempeh, however, it turned out terrible! It is a very tough soy-based protein, so if it is not cooked properly, then it won&#x27;t be very tasty. </p><p>I read several blogs, saying that you can bake it as is.. Others say you need to steam it. I decided to go with steaming. I did about 20-30 minutes of steaming. Even after 30 minutes, it felt tough! Now I realise that 15 minutes would have been sufficient as later baking makes it softer. </p><p>After steaming the tempeh, it was marinated with oregano (1 tsp), yogurt (2 tbsp), lemon juice (1 tbsp), salt (1 tsp) and pepper (1/4 tsp). I allowed it to soak up the marinate for 1 hour before I baked the tempeh. Usually, I would let the marinade soak for 3 hours min, however, as the tempeh was hot and the proteins somewhat denatured from the steaming, I thought that 1 hour was sufficient enough to allow the tempeh to absorb the flavour.</p><p>The tempeh was placed in an oven proof dish (trying to conserve the marinate in the dish) and baked for 10 minutes at 220 °C, mixed with the excess marinade and then baked for another 10 minutes. </p><p>The tempeh was then used as a chicken substitue in a wrap, with a homemade tzatzkiki and flatbread. </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHMIEHjhjxs?si=faVa6XkIVwEvP7TV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/my-vegetarian-cookbook">my vegetarian cookbook</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/cooking">cooking</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/tempeh">tempeh</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2024/June/mudge-24">Mudgee, NSW 🍷</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-06-11T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 11, 2024</time> · <!-- -->17 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Over the long weekend, Nick and I headed to 📍 <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mc1zKcQgysVsQXE17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mudgee, NSW, Australia</a> with a group of Nick&#x27;s friends. We were staying in a cute house in Erudgere (~10 mins from Mudgee centre). It was a large house, with 2 bathrooms (and an ensuite, which was apart of a different bedroom - not ours), which were very modern. The house appeared to be recently renovated. There were 7 bedrooms, each containing double beds. We took the bedroom opposite the kitchen. </p><p>This place had a large backyard with the most incredible spa (we went in every night!!! I cannot resist a large body of water). There was also a fire pit located in the yard (about 25 m from the house). Every night, we sat by the fire. It was pretty great. Over the time that we were here, the temperatures were very cool with a maximum of 14 °C. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="friday-7-june-2024"><em>Friday 7 June 2024</em><a href="#friday-7-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to friday-7-june-2024" title="Direct link to friday-7-june-2024">​</a></h4><p>We drove up on Friday afternoon. We were very lucky that our neighbours were happy to mind Chip and we said that we should gift them some wine as a thankyou. We arrived at 8.30 pm, after a 4 hour long trip, with very little traffic (most traffic through the Blue Mountains). On the drive, I was astounded at how many cars were travelling this far west. I thought to myself that surely they are not all going to Mudgee? Once we passed Lithgow, all the traffic mostly subsided and we drove alone on the roads.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="saturday-8-june-2024"><em>Saturday 8 June 2024</em><a href="#saturday-8-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to saturday-8-june-2024" title="Direct link to saturday-8-june-2024">​</a></h4><p>On the Saturday morning, we headed into town and bought coffee from <em>Althea by Zin.</em> This was a very cute little bakery, which sold artisan bread and other pastry treats. The coffee was pretty good, despite us having to order a double shot, and also considering that it was pretty expensive ($11 for two coffees). </p><p>We returned home by 10 am and at 11 am, Adam (a local wine tour guy) picked us up to take us to and from Robert Steins Vineyard (for $100). We had a 11.30 am wine tasting. The wines were good (not sure how else to comment about them). My favourites were definitely the Dry rose and the 2021 Shiraz. </p><p>Lunch was booked at 12 pm at Pipeclay (the restaurant attached). We sat at a long table booked for 11. Our lunch consisted of a 6 course meal, each meal with a wine pairing, which spanned 3.5 hours! The six courses included: </p><ol><li>Pipeclay Pumphouse Charcuterie: which was basically a cheese/meat board with bread. The bread served was pretty amazing. </li><li>Watercress, shiitake mushrooms, chestnut and poached egg: A green soup which I thought was super tasty! However, the poached eggs were over cooked and very hard, despite the waiter describing that the main feature of the dish was the &quot;soft egg and runny yolk.&quot;</li><li>Beef carpaccio with ginger and lemongrass: It looked amazing, however, for me (the vegetarian), they substituted the meat for sweet potato. It was tasty!</li><li>Chinese Five Spice  duck breast with squash, potato and broccolini. This meal was the highlight. The duck alternative was pumpkin. The dish was exactly the same, only the duck was substituted. I noted the flavours of the spice and the milky mash potato underneath. I especially liked the peppery taste of the pumpkin. I would like to try and recreate this dish at some point.</li><li>Strawberry sorbet as the palate cleanser before dessert, which was: </li><li>Spiced coconut custard tart with banana and green tea ice cream. I can&#x27;t comment too much about it. It was good. Probably as good as a tart can get. </li></ol><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/mudgee1-a34fcc3c709ebb1aa47caaeb42364f21.jpeg" width="1280" height="868" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img Caption: Robert Steins six course meal.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>While the meals were tasty, I left the restaurant after 3.5 hours still feeling hungry. It is not enough to simply substitute the meat for vegetables. It seemed like it wasn&#x27;t really considered, and they only cared for creating a similar flavour. In addition, the service was very slow! I felt like I spent my whole day there, and I did!</p><p>The wine pairings were pretty good as well. However, the waiter forgot our last pairing! It really did undermine their services there and I probably would not recommend this place, nor return, considering that we paid $110 per person + $60-80 for the wine pairing. Furthermore, it seemed like the staff constantly forgot about us, with people who arrived hours after us, leaving before us!! </p><p>Just before we got our coffees, the bus driver arrived to pick us up. We ended up taking a takeaway coffee on the bus on the drive back to our accomodation, where we enjoyed a fire and BBQ dinner. </p><p><em>Sunday 9 June 2024</em>
We were up at 7 am, and headed into Mudgee on a coffee run. We drove about 10 minutes to the Dancing Goat, where we ordered 9 coffees (including a coffee for ourselves). </p><p>The Dancing Goat was a cute coffee shop, which seemed to be family owned and run. There were kids under 12 working as the Hostess and the Cashier. We immediately felt bad for our large order, but it didn&#x27;t matter because they handled it rather well. The coffees came out in under 10 minutes, hand delivered to us in two very stable carry trays. </p><p>After returning back to the house and eating breakfast with coffee, we headed off on a wine tour with Scotty (an employee of Adam). He picked us up at 9.35 am to which we arrived at our first winery for the day: </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-heslop">1. Heslop:<a href="#1-heslop" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Heslop:" title="Direct link to 1. Heslop:">​</a></h3><p>When we arrived (~9.50 am), I was thinking that we would have to wait until they open (usually 10 am?), but they let us start early. As we walked through the front Garden, we arrived at a house. There were two people who greeted us - a woman named Julie, of about 65-70 years and a male of about 40 years of age, named Liam. They were a mother and son duo. They also mentioned that there was another member, Bob (Julie&#x27;s husband) but he was currently constructing a new wine cellar.  </p><p>They led us into a small cosy room, decorated with a wide variety of wines. Julie was leading the wine tour and she allowed us to try a wide range (7-10 wines) of wines, with 95% of the grapes grown on site (the other 5% were grown as Bunnamagoo). Some wines of interest was the vermentino. We later learned that Vermentino is a grape that is trying to replace the Savignon Blanc (from NZ), as the acidity can be better controlled. The Rose, and Zinfandel were also pretty amazing wines and the best of Mudgee. </p><p>Although, Zinfandel (I knew nothing about this grape variety previously), is a grape grown in California. Liam (the wine maker) spent 1 year abroad in California and fell in love with &quot;Zin&quot; and decided to invest in it. They now are one of a few wineries that grow Zinfandel in Mudgee. </p><p>As we were deciding of the wines to buy, Julie said &quot;If you are saving yourself for the rest of the day because you think they might get better.... let me tell you, they  don&#x27;t. They are not as good as here.&quot; She was right. They were the best wines of the day to which I later (Monday) voted them the best Wine cellar of Mudgee. </p><p>We purchased 3 bottles from Heslop, including 2x Vermentino&#x27;s and 1x Shiraz. I will put this winery on my list to return to next time I visit Mudgee. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-bunnamagoo">2. Bunnamagoo:<a href="#2-bunnamagoo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Bunnamagoo:" title="Direct link to 2. Bunnamagoo:">​</a></h3><p>The next place was <em>Bunnamagoo</em>. It was more of a commercial vineyard, yet it had a really pretty lookout onto the landscape. Most of the white wines I did not enjoy here... Until we got to the reds. The reds were quite enjoyable and we ended up buying a Cabernet Shiraz Merlot and a Shiraz which was so delicious! Funny story though, as we were loading the van with our wines, Nick set off the fire extinguisher. It let out a whole lot of foam, which everyone joked about for the rest of the day. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-huntington">3. Huntington:<a href="#3-huntington" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Huntington:" title="Direct link to 3. Huntington:">​</a></h3><p><em>Huntington</em> followed. It was also a very pretty vineyard. Lots of bushery and trees still containing their &#x27;autumn leaves.&#x27; When we entered the cellar, we were escorted upstairs to a medium sized room, with a long, narrow, wooden table to seat 11. We sat on wooden stools and a tall guy (sorry I do not recall his name) talked us through the wines. Attached to the room was a bathroom. From where I was sitting I could clearly see a bathtub and a shower. Over the bath was a long board and wine bottles stacked atop. It seemed like it was an old converted house where they did wine tastings. </p><p>The wines here were nicer than Bunnamagoo (in my opinion). Some noteworthy wines were the Chardonnay which I finally realised, has a certain butteriness to it. I had heard people comment about the butteriness of Chardonnays but I never really tasted it or realised this taste until now! All the reds were again very nice, and we ended up buying a Shiraz Cabernet. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-moothi-estate">4. Moothi Estate<a href="#4-moothi-estate" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Moothi Estate" title="Direct link to 4. Moothi Estate">​</a></h3><p>The next place we showed up at was <em>Moothi Estate.</em> It was meant to be for lunch, but the only thing on their menu were cheese boards and fries. Their service was also very slow. Later I was informed that it was shutting down the next day. Nevertheless, this place was not memorable for me. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-craigmoor-and-burnbrae-vineyards">5. Craigmoor and Burnbrae Vineyards<a href="#5-craigmoor-and-burnbrae-vineyards" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. Craigmoor and Burnbrae Vineyards" title="Direct link to 5. Craigmoor and Burnbrae Vineyards">​</a></h3><p>We went to a few more places after this, including <em>Craigmoor</em> and <em>Burnbrae Vineyards</em>. There was nothing really memorable about these places. For one thing, the staff at Craigmoor were very distracted, and did not explain much of the wines. This is most likely due to everyone getting to choose their own wines and our wine conniseur trying to meet everyones needs. The staff at Burnbrae were very nice, however, by this point we were so tired and I was almost sick with each sip of wine. However, we did buy a bottle from here, as usual, a Shiraz. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/mudgee2-a33cd78aefa7bb9124c6a9b99a1aeaa1.jpeg" width="1280" height="638" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img Caption: A few pics of my favourite wineries of the day</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="some-notes">Some notes<a href="#some-notes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Some notes" title="Direct link to Some notes">​</a></h3><p>I have a few observatory notes about the wineries and vineyards around Mudgee: </p><ol><li>You will always pay a Wine Tasting fee regardless of the amount of wine that you buy. </li><li>The wines are cheaper than those in the Hunter Valley. </li><li>It is a different vibe, less laid back than the Hunter Valley. </li><li>It was less touristy than the Hunter Valley. </li><li>Maybe a little more &quot;snobby&quot; about the wines here. </li></ol><p>I also want to comment that five wineries in one day is TOO MUCH. I already knew this before hand, but I must stress this here. After the first three, the wines felt like a chore to drink and I enjoyed them far less. It was very annoying that we arrived back so late (close to 5 pm), and I was feeling very stressed that I could not run or do anything else aside from drink wine. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="monday-10-june-2024"><em>Monday 10 June 2024</em><a href="#monday-10-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to monday-10-june-2024" title="Direct link to monday-10-june-2024">​</a></h4><p>We slept in until 8 am. My legs were hurting a little bit, maybe from laying down for so long, or the lack of training over this weekend. We got up, dressed, and cleaned the kitchen from last nights pizza&#x27;s and then headed into Mudgee for breakfast. </p><p>We were planning to go back to the Dancing Goat, however, when we parked, there were lots of people lined up waiting for a seat and therefore, we decided to go somewhere else. We ended up going to Alby and Esters. It was a cute cafe in a garden. There were street side seating, then once you walked through a short alley way, there was an open garden filled with tables, and two different indoor seating areas. It was a rather large space for dinning in. When we walked in, it was pretty busy but we still managed to get a seat inside. It was noisy inside but since it was pretty cold (under 10 degrees), we decided to stay put. </p><p>We ordered coffees (strong) and breakfast: Poached eggs for me and a jaffle for Nick. It was a nice breakfast. Our meals came with a side of tomato relish which gave the eggs more flavour. The tomato relish was amazing, which we later realised that they made themselves, with jars onsale to the public. I commented about how we should eat tomato relish more often. I noted that I should add it to our breakfast rolls. </p><p>After breakfast, we ordered  another coffee and a lemon + blueberry (gluten free) cake. It was an enjoyable morning and we left the cafe with full bellies. We returned back to the house at 10.30 am but we were straight out of the door again as the gang wanted to go to the Cheese shop. We headed to High Valley Cheese Co. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="high-valley-cheese-co">High Valley Cheese Co.<a href="#high-valley-cheese-co" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to High Valley Cheese Co." title="Direct link to High Valley Cheese Co.">​</a></h3><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/mudgee4-b85a46c9613811ea692404d026934163.jpeg" width="1280" height="462" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img Caption: Cheese tasting at High Valley Cheese Co.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The High Valley Cheese Co. is located very close to Mudgee town,maybe 5 mins or so. It is clearly visible from the road. It was a rather small shop located on a large property. The shop fit about 10 people at one time (very squashed). The cool thing was that the cheese tastings here were free! This is the only tasting that we have been to thus far that has been free. </p><p>We tried a range of cheeses, from feta to cheddar and blue cheese. They were very tasty. I didn&#x27;t have much of an appetite when we arrived and so I did not try the Feta. However, I was told that it was delicious and there were many people in the group who bought one of the Feta variations. The other cheeses that we tasted included the Caerphilly, Smoked Cheddar, Smoked Chilli cheddar, Brie, Rouge, Stefan Blue and Coil Y Blue. All the cheese were enjoyable aside from the last one. The Coil Y Blue literally tasted like a farm (but I do not enjoy blue cheese). </p><p>As there were 11 people in our group, there was a backlog of people lining up, and the line spanned out a few meters. I later thought to myself that I would hate to stand in that line, because it moved very slowly. But the cheese conniseurs were very good at their job and it was my favourite tasting today!!!</p><p>We ended up buying the Smoky cheddar cheese and the Rouge. The smoky cheddar was so smoky! I loved it the most. The Rouge was a version of brie, slightly younger but also very nice. </p><p>Next stop was Mudgee town so some of the gang could get coffee and then we were off to Bakers &amp; Williams Distillery.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bakers--williams-distillery">Bakers &amp; Williams Distillery<a href="#bakers--williams-distillery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bakers &amp; Williams Distillery" title="Direct link to Bakers &amp; Williams Distillery">​</a></h3><p>Bakers &amp; Williams Distillery was booked for 12 pm at $5 pp. As we walked through a side fence, we walked through a yard with an amazing view of a vineyard.

We tried a variety of Gins and Liqueurs, which we were informed were all made onsite. Even the waxing of the bottles was done onsite.
The tasting list consisted of: </p><ul><li>XLCR Gin: This tasted like a normal Gin to me, and I am not a huge fan, however Nick loved it! </li><li>Shiraz Gin: Was better but still not my style. The taste was improved when mixed with a grapefruit soda. </li><li>#Orancello: This was pretty amazing. Exactly like lemoncello, just with orange. We ended up buying a bottle of this. </li><li>Lemon Myrtle: This was pretty nice as well. </li><li>Cafe Liquor: Also great, tasted like an iced coffee.</li><li>Butterscotch Snapps: SO good! Tasted like butterscotch sauce. </li></ul><p>Despite the group buying a number of liquers, we still had to pay a tasting fee. </p><p>Next, we headed for lunch at Blue Wren.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blue-wren-farm">Blue Wren Farm<a href="#blue-wren-farm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Blue Wren Farm" title="Direct link to Blue Wren Farm">​</a></h3><p>Lunch was booked for 1.30 pm, but we showed up to Blue Wren Farm ~40 minutes early. They allowed us to sit. The waiters were very good and accomodated us very well. However, there was not much to eat for vegetarians, so I had bread and potatos for lunch + a lemon lime and bitters. I wasn&#x27;t too fussed though because I was still full from our large breakfast. It just annoyed me that it costed $40 just for bread and potatos. Once everyone was finished eating, I was pretty keen to leave and do other things with the day. </p><p>The final destination was the Pieter Van Gent Vineyard. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pieter-van-gent-vineyard">Pieter Van Gent Vineyard<a href="#pieter-van-gent-vineyard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pieter Van Gent Vineyard" title="Direct link to Pieter Van Gent Vineyard">​</a></h3><p>Pieter Van Gent is located on a large farm. As you enter the drive way there were several lodges and paddicks, seeming to be accomodation for tourists. As we approached the end of the dirt driveway, we found a parking lot to the right of a farmhouse. On the outside of the farmhouse entrance, there was a nice sign advertising that this was a cellar door. The entrace pathway was about 10 m long, with large barrels, of a rusty brown colour on either side. As I walked through the entrance, the floor was covered in grey stone and the lighting was rather dull to give a very cool jazzy farmer vibe. There were a number of tables and chairs which lined the corridor of the long entrance way. We sat in a &quot;U shape&quot; seating, where we were greeted by a wine connoisseur who seemed to know a lot about the wines. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/mudgee5-6ac6038fec2de454f947a8bdfe47fc76.jpeg" width="1280" height="481" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: Large wooden barrels that filled the corridor.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Our tasting consisted of five wines ($10 pp/tasting) including a vermentino, moscato, Shiraz, Tawny and a &quot;white port&quot;. We learned that this place specialises in Tawny and so many members of our group loved it. Most of the wines here were not my style, however, the 2013 Shiraz was pretty nice and we ended up purchasing a bottle ($20 special, but with tasting fee it costed $30). </p><p>I was glad that we got back before the sunset today, so I could go for quick 5 km run. It made me feel great after a long weekend of drinking wine. Other wineries were suggested to us, which will be on the list for the next time we go, including <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/kXz5CTgC7jScMVzX6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lowe Family Wines</a> and Di Lusso (although, the owners are planning to sell so may not be around for much longer).</p><p>In the evening, we enjoyed another fire. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/mudgee6-abadba4b52cc4795d8d7873c80c7ca5b.jpeg" width="960" height="1280" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img Caption: Our evening fire to keep warm in Mudgee</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tuesday-11-june-2024"><em>Tuesday 11 June 2024</em><a href="#tuesday-11-june-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to tuesday-11-june-2024" title="Direct link to tuesday-11-june-2024">​</a></h4><p>We were up at 7 am, cleaning and packing before heading off at 8 am. We stopped at the Dancing Goat Cafe in Mudgee and ordered a coffee and takeaway rolls: a B&amp;E roll for Nick and an Egg roll for me. Note: they weren&#x27;t so much rolls as they were burgers, and they were pretty great as well. This was my favourite cafe in Mudgee and I would go back here again if we ever come back to Mudgee. </p><p>As we drove in the dark on the way to Mudgee, we did not get to see any of the features such as the rolling hills and the mountenous backdrop. The drive home was pretty great, especially heading through the Blue Mountains. Nick and I spoke about the rolling hills and how how cool they were. In terms of country and land, Mudgee is a lot nicer to look at than the Hunter Valley (in my opinion).</p><p>A 4-hour drive later and we were back in Wollongong.</p><p>Note to self: 5 days is too long to go without running, as my legs felt exhausted after the 5 km run.

From my <a href="/blog/2024/May/spinach_cheese_triangles">previous post</a>, I prepared puff pastry with flour, butter and water. The puff pastry was then used to make spinach and cheese triangles. They were very nice, but the pastry was very sweet. Therefore, I wanted to create a recipe that was less sweet and more to my tastes. To achieve this, I decreased the amount of butter and added oil and extra salt. </p><p>The ingredients were as follows: </p><div align="center"> 400 g plain flour <br> 1 tsp salt <br> 53 g butter <br> 1 tbsp olive oil <br> 155 g water <br> </div><p><em>Method:</em>
In a large mixing bowl, the flour and salt were combined. Butter was chopped into small squares and using my hands, the flour and butter were rubbed together creating a crumbly flour. Next, the oil was added and the flour/butter mixture and oil were gently rubbed together (now, the texture was more crumbly). Finally, I added 155 g water (Note, I weight out the water, but it would equate to 155 mL). and used my hands to mix. The mixture was crumbly, but good enough to roll out. With floured hands and a lightly floured surface, I rolled the dough out into a long, thin pastry (maybe 0.5 cm thick?). Next I folded it several times onto itself and covered in plastic wrap. The covered dough was placed in the fridge.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pastry2-9f2e8275824cd100584942f5cd58d64f.jpeg" width="1280" height="383" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: From preparing the crumbling dough by rubbing ingredients together, to rolling out the dough and folding it into a plastic wrap</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I think 2 hours is adequate enough to chill the pastry, however, I left it in the fridge until I wanted to use it. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="further-preparation">Further preparation<a href="#further-preparation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Further preparation" title="Direct link to Further preparation">​</a></h2><p><em>2.6.24</em><br>
I pulled the dough out of the fridge and unwrapped it. There were folding marks present, however once I rolled it out with a rolling pin, the dough became smooth again. I tried to roll it out as thin as I could and then cut it into three sections. One filled the inside of a pan, and the other is to act as a pie top (for dinner tomorrow night, see image 1 below). Both were covered and placed in the fridge again. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pastry3-8e28a7de5c3324474ce20bb3bc1581a4.jpeg" width="1280" height="554" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Img caption: Preparation of a pie (left) and the cheese triangles after baking (right)</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cheese-trianges">Cheese trianges<a href="#cheese-trianges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cheese trianges" title="Direct link to Cheese trianges">​</a></h3><p>With the third section, I divided it into five small triangles. 1 tsp of filling was placed in the centre of each triangle and then it was folded onto itself several times to make a triangle like shape.

As a condition of PhD submission, you needed to send through a form including five nominated examiners. Jadranka was one of them. At this point, I am not sure if she was my reviewer but I admire her a lot and if she was, I am hoping that she enjoyed reading my thesis.</p><p>Recently, Jadrank&#x27;s group released a paper, where they synthesised a polymer brush or &quot;<em>graft</em> copolymer. A polymer brush looks like a bottlebrush plant on the molecular level. In this work, 3-hexylthiophene was polymerised using chemical oxidation with  FeCl<sub>3</sub>. Following, 2-thiophene acetic acid was added to the reaction mixture to create a carboxylic acid terminated group. The carboxylic acid groups were then grafted to a gelatin polymer using EDC/NHS coupling. This method covalently cross-links a carboxylic acid with a terminal amine group, forming a peptide bond. The % of P3HT in the graft copolymer was determined to be 9.05% using UV-vis spectroscopy. A calibration curve of P3HT was generated, which allowed the mass to be determined and thus the overall wt % in the polymer. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/graft_cp-e3c2d29b1b2b60c036e36b475a20041f.jpeg" width="1280" height="703" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">*Fig 1. (a) Synthesis of P3HT from 3HT via chemical oxidation and then reaction with 2-thiopheneacetic acid, (b) covalent attachment of P3HT to gelatin to create a brush structure.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now, when I think of polymer brush, I think of good mechanical properties (see <a href="/science/polymer-science/structures/molecular-polymer-brushes">Molecular Polymer Brushes</a>)! Which means these types of materials could be used as potential pressure sensors.The conjugated nature of P3HT also means that it can be used as an electronic device.</p><p>Through a THF/H<sub>2</sub>O cosolvent, thin films (9.05 wt% P3HT) were dropcast on Au electrodes. The conductivity of this system was determined to be 1.64 ± 0.02 x 10<sup>-7</sup> S/cm. In contrast, a second copolymer that contained 1.23% P3HT, exhibited &quot;no appreciable conductivity&quot; likely due to the poor network formation or intercalation of the alkyl chains of P3HT to prevent interchain charge transport. Exposure to a collagenase type II allowed for cleavage of the peptide bonds between the gelatin and P3HT. The hydrophobicity of P3HT meant that it would form spherical nanoparticles once the polymer brush degraded, with gelatin as the hydrophillic polymer, forming a corona around the particle and preventing toxicity from the P3HT. </p><p>Now, this work is cool. I love groups that do little tricks to make new polymers from existing stuff. However, I see study after study that create new materials or do some neat chemistries and it ends up nowhere. We already know the importance of biofunctionalising conducting polymers to create better biocompatible materials for a biointerface. I&#x27;d like to see someone commercialise this stuff! or create a device with it. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reference">Reference<a href="#reference" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reference" title="Direct link to Reference">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.4c02174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sun, X.;  Chan, E.

I had just prepared a butter tofu and rice for dinner, but it was only 5 pm (we usually eat at 6 pm). As I was cleaning up, I had a desire to bake more bread. But I didn&#x27;t want to make anymore bread, especially considering that I still had a dough in the freezer! Therefore, I decided I would make puff pastry for dinner the following night. The initial recipe that I went with wanted 250 g of butter! I cut it down to 170g and added a excess of water and refrigerated for a longer period of time:</p><p align="center"> 250 g flour<br>1/4 tsp salt<br>170 g butter<br>2 cup water<br></p><p><em>extra flour for dusting</em> </p><p></p><p>So basically, I blended the flour and butter to make a crumbly consistency and then the water to create a dough. It was meant to be very crumbly, but because I added too much water, it was very sticky. I needed to compensate by adding more flour. Once the dough was very crumbly, I rolled it out into a long rectangle and then folded several times. I covered it in plastic wrap and placed in the fridge. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="preparing-and-cooking-the-triangles">Preparing and cooking the triangles<a href="#preparing-and-cooking-the-triangles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Preparing and cooking the triangles" title="Direct link to Preparing and cooking the triangles">​</a></h2><p><em>23.5.24</em> </p><p>Next, I pulled the dough out of the fridge, unwrapped it and rolled it to be a little thinner. I divided it into 6x rectangles. Note: this dough was so sticky that they definitely were not rectangles! I prepared the pastry filling as follows: </p><p align="center">1 Garlic<br>1/2 onion<br>handful of spinach<br>1 tsp bread crumbs<br>1/4 cup tasty cheese<br>1/4 cup mozarella<br>1 egg</p><p>Basically, in about 20 g of butter, I fried up garlic and onion and spinach. It was cooled slightly, then i added all the remaining ingredients and mixed well. </p><p>I then added ~1 heaped table spoon to the pastries and folded as best as I could into triangles....

However, I will do things differently next time. I will cut out more of the butter if possible and swap for a bit of olive oil oil, so that the flavour more closely resembles pizza dough, rather than biscuits. These pastries were very sweet and so I would have liked to add a bit more salt to make them go well with the savoury filling.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/cooking">cooking</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/bread">bread</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/pastry">pastry</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/my-vegetarian-cookbook">my vegetarian cookbook</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/life">Life</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/science">Science</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/phd">PhD</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 Carly Baker.</div></div></div></footer></div>
