A PhD can be done in under a year.">​</a></h4><p>Its true. A PhD is a process. You learn, you get trained on how to do research, you make mistakes and stress over the smallest things. But everything you do in your first two years only builds you up to be a better researcher. </p><ul><li>A passage taken from <a href="/phd/side-projects">Side-projects</a>:</li></ul><p><em>This is a little anecdote about experience. A guy fixes an instrument in 20 minutes and charges $20,000. When the customer remarks about the cost of fixing, he then says &quot;it&#x27;s 20K now, but also 20 years of my life&quot;. I am starting to realise the depth of this as the work that I did in two weeks is equivalent to about a year of my PhD. If I started my PhD fresh, right now, I could probably smash it out in 6-9 months.... But it took me 3 years to get to this point.</em> </p><p>Therefore, the take home message should be: <strong>be kind to yourself.</strong> Enjoy the learning process and spend this time working on yourself, because it is really the only time you will get. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="keep-an-ideas-notebook">Keep an Ideas notebook<a href="#keep-an-ideas-notebook" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Keep an Ideas notebook" title="Direct link to Keep an Ideas notebook">​</a></h4><p>The thing that I have learned in my PhD is that not all ideas are good. Some are bad, and while making mistakes helps you learn, sometimes it is not worth your time. At the start of my third year of uni, I decided that whenever I had an idea, I would write it down in a word document that I kept on my cloud. I would add different ideas in there, whether it was about reactions or applications or things to write about, paper ideas. It is only when my mind returns to that idea constantly that I decide to do it. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teaching-compliments-lab-work">Teaching compliments lab work<a href="#teaching-compliments-lab-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Teaching compliments lab work" title="Direct link to Teaching compliments lab work">​</a></h4><p>If I have any advice for PhD students, it is to take on some teaching. Teaching high-school and undergraduate chemistry forced me to relearn really basic chemistry concepts that complimented some of the things I was doing in the lab. A classic example is in [<!-- -->[Salt exchanges]<!-- -->]. Simple chemistries are often overlooked when doing more complicated chemistries such as a PhD project. It helps to go back to fundamentals and really understand what you’re doing and get paid for it.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="take-some-time-to-think-about-everything-you-do-even-if-it-looks-like-you-are-being-unproductive">Take some time to think about everything you do, even if it looks like you are being unproductive.<a href="#take-some-time-to-think-about-everything-you-do-even-if-it-looks-like-you-are-being-unproductive" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Take some time to think about everything you do, even if it looks like you are being unproductive." title="Direct link to Take some time to think about everything you do, even if it looks like you are being unproductive.">​</a></h4><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="12423">12.4.23<a href="#12423" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 12.4.23" title="Direct link to 12.4.23">​</a></h6><p>This was a hard lesson that I had to learn. Thoughout this blog, I often complain about my PhD meetings. I think it stems from the beginning when I was quite insecure of my intelligence, and was overwhelmed with imposter syndrome (Note, I still am). I think that my supervisors (mostly Damia) were quite harsh about my progress. I realise now that they were just trying to push me to be better.</p><p>From the start of my PhD, when I had nothing much to present at my PhD meetings, comments would be thrown at me like: “is this all you’ve done?”. Of course, these comments pushed me to do more and more, but when I was stumped by a problem, I didn’t take the opportunity to sit and really think about it. Instead, I did more and more lab work that probably didn’t need to be done. In turn, it wasted more time than if I had just sat down for a few days and thought about it. <strong><em>Afterall, a PhD is a marathon. You have time.</em></strong></p><p>From the start of my PhD, Pawel said to me “A Day of reading can save you a week in the lab.” He often said this to me in my first year. I’m starting to really respect the things that he told me. While I worked hard and am close to finishing, I could have done less and still been at the same point. Imagine, 10-hour days of running around the lab: would make you quite sick of it. Well, it has and I’m trying my hardest to stay out of the lab these days.</p><p>Previously, if I had an idea, I would immediately try it out. I got a lot of success from this method. I also wasted some materials that could&#x27;ve had better use. Now, when I have an idea, I write it down and then sit on it for a few days. Usually I forget about it, which means that it probably wasn&#x27;t worth it. </p><p>Now I’ll tell you about some of the struggles ive been facing lately that has made me really <strong>wish that I spent more time thinking than doing.</strong></p><p>In a multistep synthesis, I’ve been trying to prepare a cholesteryl triethyleneglycol derivative. I did it successfully the first time in Oct 2021, but since then I can’t seem to make it. <strong>1.5 years!</strong> I did all my characterisations with this material, and while I could probably write my thesis with the data I have, I need more to fill in missing pieces of the story.</p><p>Since Oct 2021, I have completed my other chapters (mostly). All I need is this material. For the last month, I have been looking over my data and trying to see what went wrong. I set up a few little experiments but in the end, I needed to pay more attention to detail.</p><p>In the Figure  below, the original synthesis resulted in an alcohol group from mixing with NaOH: The hydroxide cleaves the tosylate. Therefore my reaction worked initially. However, overtime, I changed the reaction condition to MeOH/NaOH and instead of getting cleavage of the tosylate group, I ended up substituting for an  -OCH<sub>3</sub> group! I needed to pay attention to the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum, because it showed this specific group. Wow, I had overlooked it.</p><p>I wonder where I would be right now, if I had just sat down and really looked at what is happening. Would I have a few papers? Be close to submission? Who cares because at the end of the day, I have learned a valuable lesson, after all it is a Research Training Degree.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="13423">13.4.23<a href="#13423" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 13.4.23" title="Direct link to 13.4.23">​</a></h5><p>Today I spoke about what I had figured out yesterday in my PhD meeting. To my surprise, I was commended for solving the problem. TBH it does feel good to have solved this problem without assistance. </p><p>After the meeting I was back in the lab and setting up the correct synthesis. Lets hope it is all straight forward from here and an easier road to my thesis. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="attention-to-detail-makes-life-much-easier-the-failures-are-telling-you-something-and-its-best-to-try-and-understand-why-it-is-failing-instead-of-repeating-over-and-over">Attention to detail makes life much easier.

For the last 6-7 months of my PhD, I&#x27;ve been trying to remake a monomer: that I initially showed had really good properties and was the highlight of my research. I tried and tried and tried. Until I paused and worked on something else. Now, as I&#x27;m writing, I still need this monomer... and do you know what the problem was?? The solvent!!!!!! I was collecting the solvent from the dry solvent tap, but turns out it wasn&#x27;t dry. It was something that I thought was a certainty, just goes to show that nothing is certain and everything should be checked. This whole time I thought it was my fault that the reaction wasn&#x27;t working. </p><p>Over the past month, I&#x27;ve attempted to dry the THF. First I tried molecular sieves, but they didn&#x27;t work because we cannot properly activate them. Next, I tried to soak in sodium metal. It seems to work, but there was a very big layer of sodium hydroxide that formed at the bottom and when I tested the dryness with benzophenone (it should be a deep blue colour when its dry),, it was still wet! </p><p>Next, I set up a distillation. The idea here is that the sodium will soak up the water and it is facilitated by heat. After it is dry, I can use the tap under the condensor to collect dry THF. Yet, after boiling it all day today, it is still not dry!!!!! <strong>Why?</strong> So frustrating. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="17323">17.3.23<a href="#17323" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 17.3.23" title="Direct link to 17.3.23">​</a></h5><p>The THF was still not dry after a few days. I disposed of the THF. I then opened a fresh bottle and then recycled the sodium from the last THF (by cutting up the sodium pieces into smaller bits). Next, I added benzophenone and it started to turn blue. However, Pawel doesn&#x27;t like me refluxing it overnight as it is a hazard, so I left it overnight. When I came in on the Friday, it had turned white: a nice layer of NaOH. I was close to a mental breakdown. I added some fresh sodium, and refluxed it for 1 hour and it still didn&#x27;t dry!!!! But the thing is, the solvent doesn&#x27;t need to be 100% dry for my reactions. I distilled out a bit of THF and set up a 0.1 g reaction scale (5 mL). Usually the material will turn pink but this time it remained white. I always thought the pink was a sign that the starting material l is reacting, but now I am realising that it may just be wet and the pink colour is a natural indicator? I guess we will see the outcome on Monday when I work up this reaction.  </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-the-start-of-your-phd-everything-you-write-can-be-used-later-make-sure-to-keep-the-notes-organised-optimise-your-system-to-refer-to-them-early-on">From the start of your PhD everything you write can be used later.

When I showed up to work on Tuesday, the analytical chemist at our facility, Patricia, approached me to talk about a GPC sample that Damia wanted me to analyse for her other student. I burst out in tears. Patricia was so accomodating and was happy to do it for me. It was quite nice, she even offered to do any of my future samples. This made me relax a little bit. </p><p>We discussed how I am coping with my PhD. Obviously not well if I broke down in tears at the mention of work. She gave me some tips:</p><ol><li><em>To write out a plan for the structure of my thesis</em>. I&#x27;ve done this so many times, but I redid a plan and started to fill in what I have and what I need. This has made me feel more organised. </li><li><em>To focus on just one thing.</em> Noone can do both writing and lab work simultaneously! - This also made me feel better. Having so much on my mind was sending me crazy. I honestly felt like I was losing my mind! She suggested that I should focus on writing for now, if I am not enjoying lab. That way, when I am sick of writing, I might be more happy in the lab and it will be fun again. </li><li>T<em>o tell my supervisors how I feel.</em> While my main supervisors are really great and understanding, one of them I am quite scared of. I don&#x27;t think she remembers what it is like to be a PhD student. She was the one to tell me that I should be doing writing and lab work simultaneously. </li></ol><p>I was quite relieved yesterday when I learned that she would not be joining our meeting. I told my other supervisors, David and Pawel, without crying that I was stressing myself into an illness. They agreed that I should focus on one thing. David said that I should do more labwork. I do not agree with this, but I do agree that I should try to prepare for my trip to New Zealand. - Yeah I forgot to mention that I get to go to NZLD for a few weeks to study my polymers using [<!-- -->[Raman spectroscopy]<!-- -->] at the end of March. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="29323">29.3.23<a href="#29323" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 29.3.23" title="Direct link to 29.3.23">​</a></h5><p>I think that my mind is starting to settle down: that is, I am freaking out less than before. I&#x27;ve smashed out the first 3 chapters of my thesis and now I&#x27;m working on Chapter 4 and 5 (the last 2 research chapters). I&#x27;ve tried to focus on one thing at a time: usually I spend 1-2 weeks in the lab and then 1 week writing. It is seeming to work. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reminding-myself-to-calm-down-because-when-i-am-calm-i-can-think-more-logically">Reminding myself to calm down because when I am calm, I can think more logically.<a href="#reminding-myself-to-calm-down-because-when-i-am-calm-i-can-think-more-logically" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reminding myself to calm down because when I am calm, I can think more logically." title="Direct link to Reminding myself to calm down because when I am calm, I can think more logically.">​</a></h4><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2323">2.3.23<a href="#2323" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.3.23" title="Direct link to 2.3.23">​</a></h6><p>I&#x27;ve been deep in freak-out mode the past couple of days. Mostly because I have given myself a dead-line of September (that is when my scholarship ends) to finish my PhD and submit my thesis but it is only 6 months away! </p><p>While I&#x27;ve been in freak-out mode, I&#x27;ve completely messed a few things up in the lab. I repeated past synthetic mistakes which caused me a lot of grief. </p><p>In talking to Sulo earlier today, she helped me relax by telling me that it is okay to spend more time solving problems but instead of having a September deadline, maybe aim to have lab-work complete by September instead. That way, when the scholarship stops, you can work while you write your thesis. </p><p>This was an extremely great point. I am doing well, I am writing everyday so it won&#x27;t take me long to pull my thesis together. Now, instead of a September deadline, I&#x27;ve told myself that my dead-line to finish all experimental is September. After which, I will find a job and write my thesis at the same time. The real date that I should be most concerned about is March 2024. This is when I will start paying $20K per semester. </p><p>After I calmed down, I went in the lab to finish some stuff off. By lunchtime I was at home writing. I realised that the silly experiments and errors I made over the last few days actually gave me some really important data into the properties of my materials. It opened up my eyes to better understand what is happening which is actually a really good thing for my thesis! </p><p>What I learned is that when I calm down, I can think more logically and things make more sense, and repeating failed experiments is sometimes a good thing - as it convinces you that it wasn&#x27;t human error. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="experiments-everything-you-do-just-for-fun-can-be-useful-when-writing-up-just-remember-to-take-good-notes">Experiments, everything you do just for fun, can be useful when writing up.

I&#x27;ve been quite upset and depressed from things not quite working in the lab. Other things also weigh on me, like the fact that the end is so close but I have a huge mountain to climb - that is writing my thesis and publishing papers with my work.</p><p>While, I have been writing my thesis and analysing all my old data, my supervisors demand a weekly meeting which is every Thursday morning. I often get stressed on Wednesday as I do not know what to present. I think I get really stressed about it because previously, I have felt incompetent by the comments my supervisors have made. I almost try <strong>not</strong> to present data to them for fear of them thinking that I am completely stupid. This is something that I need to get over. </p><p>Last week, one of my supervisors asked me why I haven&#x27;t been working on my first research paper. I explained that I felt a little bit lost and like I was going in circles. Honestly, I felt like every meeting was not helpful at all, because there are 4 experienced academics who do not agree about the direction of  a project that I have been working on. </p><p>However, she did motivate me a little after that meeting and now, on Wednesday afternoon, I can say that I have something to show my supervisors tomorrow. In fact for the last few hours, I&#x27;ve been writing and reading and I noticed something in the literature that resembled my data - that I had previously dismissed. </p><p>I went back to my July 2022 folder with experimental data: Experiments that I did in the lab &quot;just for fun.&quot; Well looking back at these experiments, I say to my past self &quot;thankyou!!!&quot; It was cool data that I didn&#x27;t realise at the time and something that I can put into my first research paper (I am working on having 3 research papers by the end of my PhD). When my paper is published I will post about all these cool things I found!</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/phd"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Home</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/phd/conferences/fpi15-conference"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Fpi15 conference 17-21 June 2023</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/life">Life</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/science">Science</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/phd">PhD</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 Carly Baker.</div></div></div></footer></div>
