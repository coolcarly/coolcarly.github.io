This misalignment resulted in double vision, which I\u2019ve adapted to overtime. I first started seeing double images when I was just 18 years old. It was a consequence of a traumatic brain injury (TBI), occuring on 23 August 2014. Back in 2014, the ophthalmologist told me \u201cThere is nothing they could do\u201d and that I just \u201cneed to live with it.\u201d At the time, he prescribed me prisms that could help to align the eyes most of the time. Yet, they were nowhere near strong enough to help all the time. "),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"As I mentioned, I have learned to adapt to this misalignment. If I tilt my head to the left, I can converge the images.  Yet, whenever I ran or walked, everything would jog up and down. At first, it made me feel nauseous. I needed to take many naps. I could no longer catch a ball, which meant that I could no longer play ball-sports such as netball \u2013 something I was good at. Instead, I switched to triathlons: swimming, cycling, and running. In years to follow, the motion started to feel good. "),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"In January 2023, I went to the optometrist in Corrimal to get a new pair of glasses with the prescribed prism. The optometrist examined my eyes and asked if I was interested in fixing this misalignment. In shock, I responded \u201cyes of course! But I was told that there was nothing they could do.\u201d The optometrist wrote me a referral to Dr Harry Leung at Southern Ophthalmology.

Firstly, my neck has become very tight from having to tilt my head to cure the double vision.

I recommend to anyone who is interested in brain plasticity. It spoke of a woman \u201cStereo Sue\u201d according to Oliver Sacks, who could not see in 3D (stereopsis).

Susan Barry spoke of the 3 surgeries that she underwent as an infant to correct her eye-alignment, but still did not correct the lack of stereopsis.
