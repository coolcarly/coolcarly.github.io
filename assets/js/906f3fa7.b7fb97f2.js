Finally, even the price of fuel per litre was $1 more expensive. I assume that maybe there is a larger tax on Fuel compared to Australia. This also explains why taxis were so expensive.

From here, we lined up for a FergBurger. "),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Waiting in line for Fergburger was pretty cool. The vibe was pretty nice and the staff were offering out menus and sunscreen (too late, we were already sunburnt). We got through the line within 15 minutes. We ordered a Tofu burger and the Ferg Deluxe, fries and a salted caramel shake. I have to say that the shake was the nicest I have ever had. As for the burger though, it was overrated and definitely not worth the hype. I have to admit, it was a nice burger, and the bun was very soft and delicious (they make the buns in house at Ferg Bakery) but I think I preferred the one that I had at Jimmy Coops in Taupo. As for the chips, they were very basic fries with nothing special to them, but perfectly tasty. "),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"After eating this burger, my stomach was very full and ready to absorb more alcohol. We first went to the Little Mez, where we had a margarita each. Next, we headed to a Whiskey bar called Bardeaux, a dark bar with jazz, 1950s vibes. We enjoyed a classic cocktail consisting of whiskey. Finally, we went to Upstairs at the Bunker. Here, we drank a red wine. This is the only place that Ive seen in NZ that offers wine from the Barossa Valley. I wanted to order the Shiraz but I decided to order a local wine instead, which I was wildly disappointed with. Not sure if it is because it was Pinot Noir, or the wine was old? After this, we headed back to the hotel and finished our final night in Queenstown.
