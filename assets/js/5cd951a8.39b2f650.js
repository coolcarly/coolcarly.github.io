We were staying in a cute house in Erudgere (~10 mins from Mudgee centre). It was a large house, with 2 bathrooms (and an ensuite, which was apart of a different bedroom - not ours), which were very modern. The house appeared to be recently renovated. There were 7 bedrooms, each containing double beds. We took the bedroom opposite the kitchen.","permalink":"/life/trips/mudge-24"}]}')}}]);
