For example, super-soft elastomers consist of a bottlebrush network to create a rubber-like material, while drug delivery carriers may form micelles in order to encapsulate small molecules. When MPBs extend, they have the ability to absorb large amounts of solvent, while also repelling other neighbouring MPBs to produce a layer of fluid between each polymer brush. MPBs can therefore decrease the frictional forces between two sliding surfaces because they are a highly hydrated lubricated material. Thus, their application in cartilage regeneration.
