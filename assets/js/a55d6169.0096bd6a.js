This was a great opportunity to read and write - which I did with the review article that we published, in early 2021. However, once we were back in the lab, I spent a lot of time in the lab - sometimes 12 hours a day. I never thought the data I had was good enough, so I kept doing the same experiments hoping to get better data. Maybe this is what everyone experiences, because even Einstein said "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results". This famous quote must have been from some of his early experiences. If I could do it all over, I would have accepted my bad results and moved on.

Additional things that I learned from writing up is that I shouldv'e kept a better record of my experiments. Throughout my first year, everything I did, failed. It wasn't until I was writing Chapter 3 of my thesis, that my supervisors made me realise that the \"failed work\" was actually meaningful. It was a way to justify the change in my starting materials. Thus, Chapter 3 was one of the hardest chapters to write up, not only because it was boring to write about failures, but because I had to scramble through all the computers in the lab to salvage my data. I hope if anyone is reading this, that they realise that all data is valuable and worth storing, or writing up.
