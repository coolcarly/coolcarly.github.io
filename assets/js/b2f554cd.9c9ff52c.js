Wow, where has the time gone? Five months left until I need to submit my PhD thesis. \\n\\nI arrived home from work after an unsuccessful day in the lab. The electrodes attached to my potentiostat were disfunctioning. I spent my 3 hours of lab time, trying to trouble shoot the problem. With the help of one of the guys in the workshop, I was able to fix the electrode. However, upon a \\"dummy test\\", the signal was not strong. I gave up, and decided to go home and not waste anymore time. \\n\\nI arrived home and prepared a quiche for dinner. I was feeling inspired by Emma (as over the weekend, she made a really awesome scrambled eggs). The egg filling alone contained some butter and rosemary. \\n\\nAfter I finished preparing dinner, I was still in the mood to cook - anything to avoid working on my thesis! I decided to prepare tomorrow nights dinner as well. \\n\\nI don\'t know about you, but I get tired of eating similar things all the time. I feel like it is super boring and not creative at all. While I was having these thoughts, I had finished the rest of our loaf of bread. That\'s when I was inspired to make some bread. \\n\\nI remember when I was much younger, around 15 years old and would often bake various things for my family. I enjoyed baking a lot - from bread to cakes. However, I saw so many people around me who were a lot better. I often compared myself to others and it really demotivated me to cook (Yes, I always wanted to be the best). I wonder what life would have been like if I didn\'t compare myself and just did the things that I enjoyed - because I enjoyed them. \\n\\nMaybe my enjoyment of baking and \\"creative cooking\\" is the reason that I chose chemistry. I always wonder what drove me to stay in chemistry. I usually say that it was because I got the best marks for the least amount of effort - which is probably true. Now, I am thinking that it was also because I was using my hands to create something. Synthesis is very similar to cooking: a step by step process to create something wonderful. \\n\\nThe funny thing is though, I struggle so much to follow recipes. The same thing applies in the lab: I struggle a lot to follow new synthetic protocols. This caused so much stress during my undergrad: as I didn\'t perform as well as some of the other students. Somehow I have made it through and am almost finished a PhD in chemistry! Sometimes I forget how amazing it is that I\'ve made it this far. Dani had to remind me earlier today when we were discussing my PhD. \\n\\nAnyway, the [Garlic & Rosemary pull apart bread](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/rosemary-garlic-pull-apart-bread/) that I made was taken from Sally\'s baking addiction. There is some good stuff on her blog! I also listed the procedure that I used (because I never follow a procedure well and there are always things that I modify or change) in my [Pull-apart bread](/life/food-and-drink/cooking/pull-apart-bread) post. \\n\\n<img src={breadPic} width=\\"50%\\" className=\\"centered-image\\" />"},{"id":"/2023/07/28/2023-07/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/28/2023-07/","source":"@site/blog/2023-07/2023-07-28.md","title":"Changing my attitude","description":"It didn\'t take long to change my attitude once I acknowledged it.","date":"2023-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 28, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":0.8,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Changing my attitude","date":"2023-07-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"prevItem":{"title":"Garlic & Rosemary Pull apart bread","permalink":"/blog/2023/08/02/2023-08/"},"nextItem":{"title":"Office critique","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/25/2023-07/"}},"content":"It didn\'t take long to change my attitude once I acknowledged it. \\n\\nOver the last few days, I have had time to reflect on my actions and my feelings and I realised that I need to be kinder to myself and try to think of \\"criticism\\" as \\"feedback\\".

This really scares me and I often worry about it. \\n\\nAt 9 am this morning, I had a meeting with my supervisors, Pawel and David to talk about my long awaited, first manuscript. We spoke about the structure and story of the research paper, and their feedback was very helpful. I\'m kicking myself that I didn\'t show them sooner and push for this to be published 2 years ago (when the work was originally done).\\n\\nDuring this meeting, I didn\'t realise that I was figgeting a lot. I was playing with my hair, biting my nails, moving around and just sitting very casually. Afterwards, Pawel pointed it out, and I was really embarrassed. I am glad that he said something to me though, because I feel like in future meetings I can pay closer attention to it. \\n\\nIn my defense though, my PhD feels very casual. I feel like my supervisors are my family; but maybe I am taking my comfort for granted. I also feel like it is not my work place. I am not treated like a staff member, nor do I get the same treatment as a staff member. \\n\\nI went home after the meeting feeling really embarrased and a bit upset. To be honest, at the moment, I don\'t like certain things about myself; like my current connection with friends or my behaviour when I am stressed or anxious. I feel like I\'ve spent a lot of time complaining about things and blaming others for my bad attitude. I need to retake control of my actions, stop complaining and just get stuff done. \\n\\nI worked through comments for the rest of the day and then around 4 pm, I decided to go out for a run. Running has always helped me cope with my anxiety. I ran 10 km - which is the most I\'ve ran since the marathon back in July 2022. My mood significantly improved since the run; however, not long after, I started to feel a bit sad. I want things to change. I want to be better."},{"id":"/2023/07/23/2023-07/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/23/2023-07/","source":"@site/blog/2023-07/2023-07-23.md","title":"Date night","description":"Last night, Nick and I went to the movies to watch Oppenheimer, followed by dinner at Din Tai Fung in Miranda.
