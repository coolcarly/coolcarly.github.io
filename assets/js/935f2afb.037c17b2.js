But your left hand can never be in the same position as your right hand, unless you break some bones. This same idea applies to chiral compounds. Chiral compounds have two pairs: a right-handed and left-handed structure (R)- and (L)-. Each individual structure is called an enantiomer. The pair make up a racemic mixture.","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/kinetics-thermodynamics":{"id":"science/kinetics-thermodynamics","title":"Kinetics vs. thermodynamics","description":"Kinetics vs thermodynamics","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/organic-bioelectronics":{"id":"science/organic-bioelectronics","title":"Organic Bioelectronics","description":"The need for new materials","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/polymer-science/conducting-polymers/about-the-structure/counterion-location":{"id":"science/polymer-science/conducting-polymers/about-the-structure/counterion-location","title":"Where is the counterion located?","description":"Organic electronics have emerged overtime as the leading candidate for future biosensing technologies due to the improved biological interface, flexible energy storage and capacity to conduct via ionic and electronic mechanisms to enhance the device sensitivity. A typical example of an organic material is a polymer. While most polymers are insulating, certain types of polymers can be doped to be made conductive. These polymers have conjugated backbones that creates an environment of delocalised electrons. In their neutral state they are insulating but once they are doped, an electron hole is created which makes them conducting.","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/polymer-science/conducting-polymers/about-the-structure/effective-conjugation":{"id":"science/polymer-science/conducting-polymers/about-the-structure/effective-conjugation","title":"The effective conjugation length","description":"In chemistry, conjugation is a term used to describe how electrons are delocalised across a structure.

Due to the high degree of localisation and distortion of a conducting polymer backbone, there is minimal participation of conduction across the backbone. In/stead, what people refer to as the conduction band is really the upper polaron or bipolaron band (Fig 1) and usually reflects the optical or electrochemical band-gap.[1]","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/polymer-science/conducting-polymers/conduction/conduction-band-gap":{"id":"science/polymer-science/conducting-polymers/conduction/conduction-band-gap","title":"Band-gap theory","description":"Conduction is the flow of electrons or ions in a material, which can be understood through band-gap theory. Band-gap theory says that in all materials there exists a valence band and conduction band. These bands represent energy levels. In a conductive material such as metal, there is no energy difference between the CB and CB, and the bands will overlap. In an insulating material, the energy gap is too large for electrons to pass and thus is \\"forbidden\\". In a semi-conductor, the energy gap exists, but electrons can move from the valence band to the conduction band in the aid of temperature, pressure or doping.","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/polymer-science/conducting-polymers/synthesis/synthesis-biomolecular-dopant":{"id":"science/polymer-science/conducting-polymers/synthesis/synthesis-biomolecular-dopant","title":"Synthesising a conducting polymer with a biomolecular dopant","description":"This is something that I have explored throughout my PhD: using an ionic biomaterial to polymerise EDOT.

Literally. We are made of polymers \u2013 whether it be the proteins that make our muscles, or the proteins we eat, to the clothes we wear. Most of the materials in our life that we take for granted are polymers.","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/polymer-science/properties/regioregularity":{"id":"science/polymer-science/properties/regioregularity","title":"Regioregularity","description":"Previously I\'ve said that a chemical structure will determine the properties of a polymer, but it\'s not just the structure of the monomer that is important. Another key aspect to consider, is it\'s regioregularity - which is a feature of a polymers structure.","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/polymer-science/properties/tacticity":{"id":"science/polymer-science/properties/tacticity","title":"Tacticity","description":"During the polymerisation of a chiral molecule (see [[Chirality]] for more information), the monomer will attach to a propagating chain in either an ordered or disordered fashion - that is, all the monomers will form right-handed polymers, left-handed polymers or random. For the former, either right-handed or left-handed polymers are termed isotactic, while the latter is termed atactic. In a situation that the individual units on the polymer chain are alternating: both left and right-handed (i.e. a racemic mixture) but in an ordered fashion, this is termed syndiotactic.","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/polymer-science/structures/molecular-polymer-brushes":{"id":"science/polymer-science/structures/molecular-polymer-brushes","title":"Molecular Polymer Brushes (MPB)","description":"Context","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/polymer-science/synthesis/darp":{"id":"science/polymer-science/synthesis/darp","title":"Direct Arylation polymerisation","description":"In the polymer community, DArP is considered to be the eco-friendly alternative for polymer synthesis. In conventional coupling reactions such as Stille and Suzuki methods, excessive prefunctionalisation of monomers with boranes or stananes are required. This requires lagre amounts of solvents to run multiple columns as well as harsh reaction conditions, all in turn resulting in a poor atomic efficiency.[1, 2]","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/polymer-science/synthesis/rdrp":{"id":"science/polymer-science/synthesis/rdrp","title":"Reverse Deactivated Radial Polymerisations (RDRP)","description":"Advances in polymer synthesis provide a means to fine-tune the properties of macromolecules by varying the size, shape, chemical composition and architecture. The invention of commonly used reversible-deactivation radical polymerisations (RDRPs) including RAFT (reversible addition\u2212fragmentation chain-transfer) polymerisation, ATRP (atom-transfer radical polymerisation) and NMP (nitroxide-mediated polymerisation) began over 20 years ago and has significantly increased the chemoselectivity of reactions; thus, RDRP allows the use of more complex and functional monomers. However, the main disadvantage of RDRPs is that extremely high molecular weights are difficult to achieve with narrow dispersity because early termination reactions may occur.","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/polymer-science/terms":{"id":"science/polymer-science/terms","title":"Terms in polymer science","description":"Like many other fields of research, polymer science has it\'s own jargon. There are many terms that are used to describe the physical and chemical characteristics of the materials that we use. Perhaps even the word Polymer is a jargon word to someone who does not study science. I\'ve had to simplify the word to my family in order to explain my research field in plain english. Therefore, this page is dedicated to defining simple terms in polymer science, starting with the very basic term Polymers.","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/science_home":{"id":"science/science_home","title":"Home","description":"About","sidebar":"scienceSidebar"},"science/sn":{"id":"science/sn","title":"Nucleophillic substitution reactions","description":"There are many types of reactions that occur in organic molecules.
