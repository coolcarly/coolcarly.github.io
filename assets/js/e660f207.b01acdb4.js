On the menu, it says that the Samosa Chat comes in 2 pieces. We were tempted to get 2 but we stuck with only 1. This was a good decision as the serving was quite large.

It was served in a butter-like sauce, similar to their butter chicken. This was too much food though and I could not finish my naan or the Palak Paneer. Nontheless, our bellies were very satisfied!
