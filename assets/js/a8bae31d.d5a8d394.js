I also feel like I had the chance to promote myself and hopefully I gave people only good vibes.

In reality, I'm not sure how I feel but I am definitely keen to move on and get a job and start to build my life and career! It's just a shame that I will part from this amazing community. I truely felt like I met some amazing people who were genuinely interested in me as a scientist and as a person. I loved how we all shared similar interests in polymers and that a lot of people remembered me from conferences that I had previously attended.
