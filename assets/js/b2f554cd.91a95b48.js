In this work, P3HT was synthesised through chemical oxidation (using FeCl<sub>3</sub>). Following 2-thiophene acetic acid was added to create a carboxylic acid terminated group. The carboxylic acid groups were then grafted to a gelatin polymer using EDC/NHS coupling. This method covalently cross-links a carboxylic acid with a terminal amine group, forming a peptide bond. The % of P3HT in the graft copolymer was determined to be 9.05% using UV-vis spectroscopy. A calibration curve of P3HT was generated, which allowed the mass to be determined and thus the overall wt % in the polymer. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when I think of polymer brush, I think of good mechanical properties (see [Molecular Polymer Brushes](/science/polymer-science/structures/molecular-polymer-brushes))! Which means these types of materials could be used as potential pressure sensors.The conjugated nature of P3HT also means that it can be used as an electronic device.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough a THF/H<sub>2</sub>O cosolvent, thin films (9.05 wt% P3HT) were dropcast on Au electrodes. The conductivity of this system was determined to be 1.64 \xb1 0.02 x 10<sup>-7</sup> S/cm. In contrast, a second copolymer that contained 1.23% P3HT, exhibited \\"no appreciable conductivity\\" likely due to the poor network formation or intercalation of the alkyl chains of P3HT to prevent interchain charge transport. Exposure to a collagenase type II allowed for cleavage of the peptide bonds between the gelatin and P3HT. The hydrophobicity of P3HT meant that it would form spherical nanoparticles once the polymer brush degraded, with gelatin as the hydrophillic polymer, forming a corona around the particle and preventing toxicity from the P3HT. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, this work is cool. I love groups that do little tricks to make new polymers from existing stuff. However, I see study after study that create new materials or do some neat chemistries and it ends up nowhere. We already know the importance of biofunctionalising conducting polymers to create better biocompatible materials for a biointerface. I\'d like to see someone commercialise this stuff! or create a device with it. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Reference\\r\\nSun, X.;  Chan, E. W. C.;  Chen, Q.;  Kirby, N.;  Yang, J.;  Mata, J. P.;  Kingston, R.

At the moment, the work is pretty slow, yet I am trying to keep busy. I have been trained on the [ICP](./icp_.md) and elemental analyser and am waiting for traiing by Greg on the digestor in order to further my training on the ICP. I hope to use it a few times in order to become more familiar since I am now the official trainer for it. While I wait for things to happen here, I have continued my learning with python. In fact, today I wrote a program with the following purposes: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. To create a new folder with the month, then a folder with the date\\r\\n2. To take a file and convert it from txt to csv\\r\\n3. To extract the X and Y values from the folder and normalise the Y column. \\r\\n4. To create a line graph of the X and normalised Y values. \\r\\n5. To export the image as a png with the date and activity as the file name. \\r\\n\\r\\nI feel as excited about programing as I did with the synthesis of my polymers. Both of these skills have different thresholds and I think they can complement each other very nicely. I just wish I could get a mixture of lab work and desk work... As I was told today \\"This place is very slow, as there are many changes happening..\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, I have been learning a bi\xact of LaTeX. It was a large hurdle and a little traumatic installing it, only for Nick to point out to me later on that Typst (which I am more fluent with) is open access for offline use (something I did not realise before). Therefore, I looked through the extensions of VSCode and found the typst extension, which I immediately installed. I began to create a template for my publications, which is much nicer than using microsoft word!!!! If I could do one thing over again, it would be to use typst for my thesis. I will definitely be using this to create reports in the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn other news, both of the examiners have returned my PhD thesis. I am yet to receive it, however, my supervisors have told me that there are mostly minor corrections (They didn\'t want to give me too much information, and later I learned that they are not allowed to tell me anything). I\'m hoping that I can correct it soon, but I am very nervous about what it will say! \\r\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\r\\n\\r\\n|![phd revision](./img/phd-revision.PNG)|\\r\\n|:---:|\\r\\n|*Caption: The only information I can get about my thesis at this point*| \\r\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2024/May/gluten-intolerance","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/May/gluten-intolerance","source":"@site/blog/2024/May/gluten-intolerance.md","title":"Gluten intolerance","description":"Bread is subjectively the best thing to exist on Earth.

Do you agree? Well about 5-10% of you will not agree. This is because gluten intolerance is a fairly prevalent allergy. Celiac disease is the name given to a gluten intolerance, which is diagnosed in about 1% of people wordwide. People with this disease experience vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, numbness in the hands and feet among many other symptoms, in response to gluten ingestion. Why does this occur?\\r\\n\\r\\nCeliac disease is commonly inherited through the genes. One genetic marker of celiac is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genotype. About 30% of people will express this genotype, however, only 1-3% of people will develop the disease. These two genes present on Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) to produce an immune response when exposed to peptides from Gliadin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I explained in my previous bread post, gluten is composed of gliadin, which is the harmful component to people with celiac. Gliadin is difficult to digest, even in healthy humans, due to the presence of prolamins (a group of plant storage proteins). These proteins are generally hydrophobic (or water-hating), with the central region composed mostly of glutamine and proline amino acids. As a result, gliaden will pass into the intestinal barrier. The presence of gliadin in the small intestine produces an inflammtory response, where cells will release tissue transamidase (tTG), often the reason why we would experience bloating in response to breads. tTg expression is increased in celliac sufferers.\\r\\n\\r\\n|![](./img/t-tg.jpg)|\\r\\n|:---:|\\r\\n|*Fig 1. (a) Crosslinking of glutamine and lysine to form a high molecular weight polymer or (b) deamidation of glutamine to form glutamate which is negatively charged at physiological pH. Both reactions are catalysed by tTG*.| \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce released from cells, tTG crosslinks a protein with a glutamine residue (in this case, the gliadin) to a protein with a lysine group, via a peptide bond. This cross-linking is an important step that leads to insoluble protein aggregates, which can be cleared from the body. However, it can also convert glutamine to glutamic acid in a process called deamidation. \\r\\n\\r\\nDeamidation of gliadin produces negatively charged peptides at physiological pH (7.4-7.6), which then has a high affinity for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. The binding of the glutamic acid to the HLA proteins, results in T-cell stimulation, followed by release of proinflammatory cytokines. This inflammatory response leads to the destruction of the intestinal villi, which are responsible for absorbing nutrients.In addition, people with celliac disease, antibodies are produced in response to the tTG release, further invoking the limitation in gliadin digestion and thus, increasing the prevalence of inflammation. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### References\\r\\n1.

The ICP in my lab at the University of Wollongong, with the labelled components*|\\r\\n\\r\\n## What is ICP?\\r\\nInductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry (MS) or optical emission spectroscopy (OES) is a method of elemental analysis which utilises a plasma source. In ICP-MS, the ions are directly measured. In contract, ICP-OES uses an optical spectrometer to measure the photons emitted as they pass through the plasma. While both methods are extremely fast to use, cheap and straightforward, the ICP-OES has a higher sensitivity to detection. \\r\\n\\r\\n## How does ICP work?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Schematic of ICP](./img/fig1-icp.jpeg)|\\r\\n|:---:|\\r\\n|*Figure 2. Schematic of ICP: (a) engineered setup and (b) behaviour of the sample inside the sample channel. Images taken from (Hou and Jones) and (McCurdy and Potter)* |\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA schematic of an ICP is displayed in Fig 2. The liquid sample is injected into a spray chamber which is converted to an aerosol via a nebuliser. During this process, only the very fine particles are injected into the inductor. In the inductor, the sample aerosol is further dried and vapourised due to the high temperatures (10000 K) in the sample carrier. In this process, all chemical bonds are broken, allowing for the vapourisation of each individual atom (Fig 2b). The free atoms collide with plasma, allowing them to transition to an excited state. Upon relaxation to ground state, the ions/atoms will emit a photon of characteristic energies, which can be used to determine the elemental origin of the ions. The total number of photons emitted is proportional to the concentration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ionisation plasma is typically argon gas as it is chemically inert and contains a high proportion of cations and electrons with a high electron density. In the set up shown in Fig 2a, radiofrequency (RF) is applied to a coil which produces \u201cseed\u201d electrons which are accelerated and collide with argon gas to form argon plasma and electrons:\\r\\n<p align=\\"center\\"> Ar(g) \u2192 Ar<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n## About sample preparation\\r\\nSolubilised solutions (aqueous or organic) are required to perform ICP analysis. Therefore, samples (<0.2 %>) are typically treated with nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) or HCl, in a process referred to as \\"acid digestion\\".  Sample concentrations of <0.2% are crucial to avoid any matrix effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Matrix effects\\r\\nMatrix effects are interferences in the analysis due ton signal dift caused by the deposition of solids on the sample apertures or signal suppression caused by salt ions. The typical salt interference is caused by oxide formation, which seems to reduce the ion flow and promotes clogging at the sample cone (the interface that analyses ion extraction). With years of research, matrix effects have typically solved through the use of OES compared to MS. ICP-OES relies on photon emission rather than ion acceleration, which makes it less susceptible to interferences. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Advantages of ICP compared to other elemental analyses\\r\\nAs ICP heats to very high temperatures, samples undergo more efficient vaporisation, atomisation and excitation. This allows for a wider range of elements to be analysed by ICP. In addition, the high temperature means that there is less water vapour present, in turn reducing the concentration of oxygen species and thus a lower level of matrix interferences caused by oxide formation. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## References\\r\\n1.\\tAmmann, A.A., Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS): a versatile tool.

With every small tweak in a recipe, I realised that there are dramatic changes, which motivated me to write about the changes in bread quality in relation to the chemistry. \\n\\nFlour contains proteins glutenin and gliadin, which combine in the presence of water to form gluten (Fig 1). Prior to the addition of water, glutenin exists as a colloid. Upon addition of water to the flour, the chains are allowed to stretch, seperate, and form new disulfide linkages. These disulfide linkages create a network of glutenin polymer that produces the strength and elasticity of bread dough. At the same time, the smaller gliadin proteins will disperse through the glutenin polymer network, which allows the bread to \\"rise\\". It is the constituent that facilitates formation of the gluten network. Due to it\'s self-assembling properties (as it is highly hydrophobic), it will associate into spherical particles and absorb other nutrients such as vitamin E. Thus, the quality of the gluten network that forms is dependent on the type of flour that is used.\\n\\n\\n| ![Schematic of gluten formation](./img/bread_schematic.jpeg) |\\n|:---:|\\n|*Fig 1. Schematic of gluten formation*|\\n\\n\\nMixing and kneading of the flour/water mixture encourages the gluten network to further develop. During this process, carbon dioxide is incorporated, producing a more porous dough once it is baked. Yet, we dont want the gluten networks to be so strong that they become chewy and tough. This is the reason that people turn to a \\"no-knead\\" method. Sometimes, a high water content is enough to facilitate formation of strong gluten networks. \\n\\nYet, there is one more ingredient that is required to create the gluten network... and that is salt. As mentioned in the [\\"salting-out\\"](/science/salt) post, salt helps to decrease the water content. In this instance, salt will remove water from the protein/polymer network to increase the strength and elasicity. \\n\\n--------- \\n\\nThe initial recipe that I started with came from Nagi: [RecipeTinEats](https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-yeast-bread-recipe-no-knead/). The ingredients required were:\\n<p align=\\"center\\"> 450 g flour <br/> 2 tsp yeast <br/> 2 tsp salt <br/> 375 mL of warm watern (~40 \xb0C) </p>\\n\\nFirst, I started off with a \\"no kneading\\" approach to bread making. I was unsure of the measurements for the yeast. I had the large container of active yeast as well as the packets. I initially used the packets, and with a quick google search I saw that 7 g was an equivalent of 2 tsp of yeast. Therefore, in my first attempt to make this bread, I activated one packet of the yeast in warm water. The bread was left for a few hours in a warm-ish environment to rise, and then it was moulded into a round ball and baked using the dutch oven.\\n\\nAfter baking, the bread was very tough to cut and very dense, but it was still quite tasty and full of flavour. These bread flavours arise from fermentation. The high density is possibly attributed to a low water content. Thus, for the subsequent loaves, I went for weighing out the ingredients using a scale instead of the \\"cups\\" measurement as a scale is more accurate. \\n\\nA few days later, I used the recommended amount of yeast (2 tsp), weighed out the flour (450 g to be exact) and the water. I saw that the dough was still a bit \\"doughy\\", so I added an extra 20 mL of water to the batch (395 mL in total). It was too sticky to be able to knead (Fig 2, img1), yet it felt very soft and after allowing it to rise for several hours, I baked it using the dutch oven. NOTE: I was sure that it had risen well, when the dough (before baking) was very bubbly on the surface and small movements of the bowl containing the dough resulted in a \\"jiggling\\" of the dough surface. This time, it rose more than the previous batch (likely due to the extra yeast) and was less dense than the last batch (owing to the excess water added).\\n\\n| ![second batch](./img/bread2.jpeg) |\\n|:---:|\\n|*Fig 2. Batch 2: (img 1) sticky dough, (img 2) moulded dough for baking, (img 3) final product.* |\\n\\nWithout a job at this point, I wanted to bake more and change the conditions to geet the best loaf. I wondered what is the impact of leaving the dough to sit for longer? What is the impact of kneading? Surely I can google this, but I wanted to experience the feeling and taste differences. Therefore, the next batch that I made, was using the same contents as above only, I allowed the dough to sit for 3 hours at room temperature, then 2 days in the fridge (covered). The day before cooking, I pulled out the dough, moulded it into a ball and allowed it to sit covered in plastic wrap in the fridge overnight. When I baked this loaf, it rose slightly more than the last batch, and was also more porous (Fig 3). From what I understand, it seems that when you put the dough in the fridge, fermentation is slowed down to allow the development of more complex flavours.\\n\\n\\n| ![third batch](./img/bread-3.jpeg) |\\n|:---:|\\n|*Fig 3. Batch 3: (img 1) moulded dough for baking, (img 2) final product and (img 3) a photo of the sliced bread, observing the porosity of the loaf.* |\\n\\n*15.5.2024* <br/>\\n\\nThe next parameter that I wanted to test is the impact of kneading on the dough. Therefore, a dough was prepared as previous, however, it was kneaded for 5 minutes of before allowing the dough to rise. Due to the better properties of the previous batch of bread, the dough was immediately placed in the fridge, in a covered bowel. The dough was left for close to 22 hours in the fridge. The dough appeared to have similar textures as the previous batch, however, was less soft upon touching it.\\n\\nThe dough was moulded and scored (using tips that I got from [vegpatchkitchen](https://vegpatchkitchen.co.uk/what-is-oven-spring/)) and baked from it\'s cold state. The idea behind scoring is that it allows the gases to uniformly escape, making bread the rise more uniform, instead of having that weird bubble in the middle of the loaf (as seen in img 2 of Fig 3).\\n\\nWhile the final bread loaf in Fig 4 (img 3) appears to be more uniform, without the ugly bubble in the middle, it was less porous than batch 3 (Fig 3). This was attributed to the small additions of flour that I added in order to knead the bread. As small amounts of excess flour decreases the water content, the bread ultimately became more dense. I thought this bread was the tastiest and best looking so far. \\n\\n\\n| ![fourth batch](./img/bread4.jpeg) |\\n|:---:|\\n|*Fig 4. Batch 4: (img 1) dough after kneading and ready to be placed in the frige, (img 2) moulded dough for baking, (img 3) final product and (img 4) a photo of the sliced bread, observing the porosity of the loaf.* |\\n\\n*20.5.2024* <br/>\\n\\nThis time, I doubled the batch size using the following ingredients:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\"> 900 g bread flour <br/> 656 g warm water (~ 40\xb0C) <br/> 4 tsp salt <br/> 4 tsp of yeast</p>\\n\\nIn this batch, the process was as follows. First, 4 tsp of dried yeast was added to 2 cups of warm water (equivalent to 427 g of water). The yeast was allowed to grow for 5 minutes and then added to the flour/salt mixture. The mixture was combined with a wooden spoon. As it appeared to be very flaky and floury, an extra 229 g of water was added. It appeared to be very slicky and slimy. It was too sticky to be kneaded, or even handled. This large batch was left in the mixing bowl, covered and put straight into the fridge for 22 hours. \\n\\nThe oven was preheated to 220\xb0C and the dutch oven was preheated for 30 minutes. During this time, half of the mixture was taken from the large mixing bowl, moulded and scored and put back in the fridge (covered) until it was ready to bake it. The dough (on the baking paper) was gently placed into the dutch oven and baked for 30 mins with the lid on, and a further 10 mins with the lid off. \\n\\nThe bread was probably the best that I have made so far (I know I say this everytime... but is true). The defining features were the high porosity caused by the high water content, the uniform growth in the dough due to scoring of the loaf and the softness of the inside! \\n\\n| ![fifth batch](./img/bread5.jpeg) |\\n|:---:|\\n| *Fig 5. Batch 5.

When I removed it from the fridge (22.5.24), the dough revealed bubbles which is indicative of gas being released. It was very sticky and very difficuit to pick up. I managed to mould it into a ball, with the aid of a small amount of flour. The dough was then wrapped in plastic wrap and placed in the freezer, where it sits until I am ready to bake again. Unfortunately due to my new working commitments, I get less time to bake! I will probably bake this loaf next week. Stay tuned!\\n\\n### References\\n1. Cho, I.H. and D.G.

David commented that the best thing to do when you are not feeling like thinking is to write out the methods chapter. He was right. Writing out my methods chapter is a simple way to get myself in the mood of writing and to continue my writing routine. \\n\\n*More unproductivity:* This morning, I went driving around Wollongong to try and get a quote to fix my passenger-side mirror of my car. Grant from Fernhill Smash Repairs told me that he would be in touch later in the afternoon. NOTE: the passenger side-mirror is no longer afixed to the car as I nipped it off on the way home from the beach yesterday. Without a passenger side-mirror, I cannot drive my car. This means that I can\'t drive to North Wollongong beach! I need to paddle in the morning for me to feel fresh for a day of writing! This screwed up my whole day. At 10 am, I gave up on writing and decided to head to Innovation Campus to get some data off the computers. I ran there and remained until 4 pm..... and that is all I did today.\\n\\nIn the evening, Nick and I walked to [The Barrel Shephard](/life/food-and-drink/craft-beer/illawarra/barrel-shephard) for dinner and drinks.

I was more than ready to make huge progress today! \\n\\nI arrived at work at 9 am and from the minute I began to do things in the lab, everything went wrong. I couldn\'t get any good data. Around 10 am, I went to get help to fix a cable for my potentiostat (as the wires lost connection to reduce the signal). However, I was unsuccessful in getting help. A colleague/researcher said to meet her at 3 pm to repair the cable; but I couldnt wait this long as I was due to teach at 1.30 til 4.30 pm (Week 3 of Semester 2).. \\n\\nBy this point it was 11 am - I was feeling really tired and unmotivated. \\n\\nMy first thought was to go home. I lost motivation when I realised that I would only be home for 1 hour before having to leave again. Instead, I pulled out my soft back warmer from my draw and used it as a pillow. I put my head down on the desk and had an hour nap. \\n\\nI woke up less tired than before, but really groggy. I packed my safety glasses and water bottle into my handbag and walked towards my car, then drove to the main campus. Travel between the innovation campus and the main campus is really tedious and it is often difficult to find parking in the middle of the day. \\n\\nI was parked and ready to get out of the car at 1 pm. I walked towards Panzinis, a cafe located in front of the UOW library. I go here for coffee because they offer staff discounts and I love discouts! I ordered my coffee and it was made within 5 minutes. It was a rather pleasant experience - too bad that I was not in a good mood. \\n\\nThe undergraduate chemistry labs are located in building 21 on level 3. I headed here after I was handed my coffee - but I was at least 20 minutes early. When I walked into the lab, it was empty abar one demonstrator - Sue. I chatted for less than a minute before rereading over my emails that said I was only rostered for Week 9. In sheer disbelief, I spent a few minutes researching my emails and was convinced that I showed up for no reason! In embarrassment, I left and drove to North Wollongong beach. \\"Wow\\" I thought. \\"How stupid\\". \\"Why didn\'t I read my emails?\\" \\n\\nI was pretty relieved though, because I didn\'t really want to teach. I don\'t need the extra funds that bad and it\'s not worth taking time away from my writing. Excited that I could fix the potentiostat, I also sent an email to a colleague, indicating my error and that I would be there at 3 pm. \\n\\nJust as I was about to get out of my car and go for a dip in the ocean to calm down my anxiety and embarrassment, I received an email from Giel (the subject coordinator) who asked me to come back because I was rostered to work. Can you believe how embarrassed I was after this? It took me 15 minutes to return, park and walk to the labs. I quickly walked into the service room, dodging the lines of students waiting to collect a pH probe for their experiment. I threw on a red lab coat, my safety glasses and grabbed a pen. \\n\\nI apologised several times to Giel and I literally felt like slapping my forehead because it was such a stupid thing that happened. The worst thing though, was sending a third email to my colleague telling her that I was wrong and I was meant to teach! \\n\\nThe labs were very slow and very basic. The students were working on acid-base titrations. In that moment, I thought that it wasn\'t too bad. I actually enjoyed it.  I\'m just glad that I don\'t have to teach all the time. The labs ended at 4.30 pm. I drove straight home and relaxed until dinner time. \\n\\nI honestly feel like I wasted the whole day."},{"id":"/2023/08/04/2023-08/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/08/04/2023-08/","source":"@site/blog/2023-08/2023-08-04.md","title":"Rewarding myself","description":"Lately, I have been freaking out with the amount of work still left in my PhD.

Wow, where has the time gone? Five months left until I need to submit my PhD thesis. \\n\\nI arrived home from work after an unsuccessful day in the lab. The electrodes attached to my potentiostat were disfunctioning. I spent my 3 hours of lab time, trying to trouble shoot the problem. With the help of one of the guys in the workshop, I was able to fix the electrode. However, upon a \\"dummy test\\", the signal was not strong. I gave up, and decided to go home and not waste anymore time. \\n\\nI arrived home and prepared a quiche for dinner. I was feeling inspired by Emma (as over the weekend, she made a really awesome scrambled eggs). The egg filling alone contained some butter and rosemary. \\n\\nAfter I finished preparing dinner, I was still in the mood to cook - anything to avoid working on my thesis! I decided to prepare tomorrow nights dinner as well. \\n\\nI don\'t know about you, but I get tired of eating similar things all the time. I feel like it is super boring and not creative at all. While I was having these thoughts, I had finished the rest of our loaf of bread. That\'s when I was inspired to make some bread. \\n\\nI remember when I was much younger, around 15 years old and would often bake various things for my family. I enjoyed baking a lot - from bread to cakes. However, I saw so many people around me who were a lot better. I often compared myself to others and it really demotivated me to cook (Yes, I always wanted to be the best). I wonder what life would have been like if I didn\'t compare myself and just did the things that I enjoyed - because I enjoyed them. \\n\\nMaybe my enjoyment of baking and \\"creative cooking\\" is the reason that I chose chemistry. I always wonder what drove me to stay in chemistry. I usually say that it was because I got the best marks for the least amount of effort - which is probably true. Now, I am thinking that it was also because I was using my hands to create something. Synthesis is very similar to cooking: a step by step process to create something wonderful. \\n\\nThe funny thing is though, I struggle so much to follow recipes. The same thing applies in the lab: I struggle a lot to follow new synthetic protocols. This caused so much stress during my undergrad: as I didn\'t perform as well as some of the other students. Somehow I have made it through and am almost finished a PhD in chemistry! Sometimes I forget how amazing it is that I\'ve made it this far. Dani had to remind me earlier today when we were discussing my PhD. \\n\\nAnyway, the [Garlic & Rosemary pull apart bread](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/rosemary-garlic-pull-apart-bread/) that I made was taken from Sally\'s baking addiction. There is some good stuff on her blog! I also listed the procedure that I used (because I never follow a procedure well and there are always things that I modify or change) in my [Pull-apart bread](/life/food-and-drink/cooking/pull-apart-bread) post. \\n\\n<img src={breadPic} width=\\"50%\\" className=\\"centered-image\\" />"},{"id":"/2023/07/28/2023-07/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/28/2023-07/","source":"@site/blog/2023-07/2023-07-28.md","title":"Changing my attitude","description":"It didn\'t take long to change my attitude once I acknowledged it.","date":"2023-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 28, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":0.8,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Changing my attitude","date":"2023-07-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"prevItem":{"title":"Garlic & Rosemary Pull apart bread","permalink":"/blog/2023/08/02/2023-08/"},"nextItem":{"title":"Office critique","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/25/2023-07/"}},"content":"It didn\'t take long to change my attitude once I acknowledged it. \\n\\nOver the last few days, I have had time to reflect on my actions and my feelings and I realised that I need to be kinder to myself and try to think of \\"criticism\\" as \\"feedback\\".

This really scares me and I often worry about it. \\n\\nAt 9 am this morning, I had a meeting with my supervisors, to talk about my long awaited, first manuscript. We spoke about the structure and story of the research paper, and their feedback was very helpful. I\'m kicking myself that I didn\'t show them sooner and push for this to be published 2 years ago (when the work was originally done).\\n\\nDuring this meeting, I didn\'t realise that I was figgeting a lot. I was playing with my hair, biting my nails, moving around and just sitting very casually. Afterwards, it was pointed it out, and I was really embarrassed. I am glad that he said something to me though, because I feel like in future meetings I can pay closer attention to it. \\n\\nIn my defense though, my PhD feels very casual. I feel like my supervisors are my family; but maybe I am taking my comfort for granted. I also feel like it is not my work place. I am not treated like a staff member, nor do I get the same treatment as a staff member. \\n\\nI went home after the meeting feeling really embarrased and a bit upset. To be honest, at the moment, I don\'t like certain things about myself; like my current connection with friends or my behaviour when I am stressed or anxious. I feel like I\'ve spent a lot of time complaining about things and blaming others for my bad attitude. I need to retake control of my actions, stop complaining and just get stuff done. \\n\\nI worked through comments for the rest of the day and then around 4 pm, I decided to go out for a run. Running has always helped me cope with my anxiety. I ran 10 km - which is the most I\'ve ran since the marathon back in July 2022. My mood significantly improved since the run; however, not long after, I started to feel a bit sad. I want things to change.
