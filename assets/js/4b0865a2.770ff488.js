"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,'Flour contains proteins glutenin and gliadin, which combine to form gluten. Prior to the addition of water, glutenin exists as a colloid. Upon addition of water to the flour, the chains are allowed to stretch, seperate, and form new linkages as a disulfide. These disulfide linkages create a network of glutenin polymer that produces the strength and elasticity of bread dough. At the same time, the smaller gliadin proteins will disperse through the glutenin polymer network, which allows the bread to "rise". Thus, the gluten content in bread is attributed to the type of flour that is used to make the bread.

Following the recipe exactly. In my first attempt, I did activate the yeast in warm water, using only 1 packet mixture (7 g). In the end, the bread was very tough to cut and very and very dense. But it was still quite tasty. These bread flavours arise from fermentation. The high bread density is possibly attributed to a low water content. Thus, instead of using "cups" measurement, I went for weighing out the ingredients using a scale. '),(0,n.kt)("p",null,'A few days later, I used the recommended amount of yeast (2 tsp), weighed out the flour (450 g to be exact) and the water. I saw that the dough was still a bit "doughy", so I added an extra 20 mL of water to the batch. It was too sticky to be able to knead, yet it felt very soft and after allowing it to rise for several hours, I baked it using the dutch oven. NOTE: I was sure that it had risen well, when the dough was very bubbly on the surface and small movements of the bowl containing the dough resulted in a "jiggling" of the dough surface.

The day before cooking, I pulled out the dough, moulded it into a ball and allowed it to sit covered in the fridge overnight.
