While in organic synthesis reactions, we use proton acceptors and donors to aid in the movement of electrons, electrochemistry utilises electric charge to move electrons. In this reaction, molecules will collide with an electrode or conductive substrate. The result is either oxidation or reduction of the material at the electrode/electrolyte interface in the electrochemical cell.","[1]"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Fig 1. three-electrode electrochemical cell\nElectrochemical cells consist of a working, counter, and reference electrode and can be divided into two-, three- and four- electrode systems. Three-electrode system configurations are the most reported for conducting polymer synthesis and characterisation. The three-electrode system sets up the working and counter, facing each other to generate an electric field (Fig 1). The reference electrode should be situated close to the working electrode but not interfere with the electric field generated by the counter electrode.\nThe type of reference electrode used will depend on the type of system employed. In organic systems, a Ag/Ag+ from Ag/AgNO3 is used, while in aqueous systems, Ag/AgCl is used. All electrodes are immersed in an electrolyte solution such as NaCl (aqueous), tetrabutylammonium perchlorate or hexafluorophosphate (organics) to facilitate ion transfer between the working and counter electrodes.","[2]","\nOnce a potential is applied to the electrochemical system, two types of reactions or currents are observed: (1) a current caused by redox processes i.e. oxidation or reduction and (2) a current caused by the charging of the [","[electrical double-layer]","].

Illusttration of electrochemical deposition of a monomer in an electrolyte solution.\nElectrochemical oxidative polymerisations can be further divided into several methods, with the most common being [","[cyclic voltammetry]","] (CV), [","[chronoamperometry]","] (CA) and [","[chronopotentiometry]","]. These three methods are powerful tools that are used for both polymer deposition onto a conductive substrate and as analytical tools to measure the electrochemical properties of CP films. They are defined as follows:\n1)\tCyclic voltammetry (CV): Cycles between potentials, usually from low reductive potentials to high oxidative potentials. This method deposits monomers slowly as it goes through several cycles of oxidation and reduction, to initiate, propagate and terminate chain growth.","[8]","\n2)\tChronoamperometry (CA): This technique measures the changes in current over time at a constant potential. A constant potential is applied to oxidise the monomer. The oxidised monomers react to form insoluble oligomers, that form a film on the conductive substrate.","[2]"," The shape of the resulting CA curve from the monomer deposition can be studied to determine the nucleation and growth mechanisms of the CP.","[9]","\n3)\tChronopotentiometry: A constant current is applied to the conductive substrate which initiates polymerisation at the surface of the conductive substrate. The potential is monitored over time at a constant current.\nThese methods for electrochemical deposition are considered \u201cgreen\u201d synthesis. This is because it is a chemical reaction that requires very little solvent. It only requires electricity in order for the polymerisation to occur. The problem with these methods of deposition is that the polymer is usually insoluble which is not desirable for 3D printing applications or applications that require processibility. The poor solubility also means that once these films have been synthesised, they are very difficult to characterise. Finally, since all the monomers that are in contact with the electrode will initiate a chemical reaction and propagate perhaps at different rates, electrochemical depositions are difficult to control. When there is limited control over the reaction, the molecular weight dispersity will be very large, which in turn negatively affects the properties of the polymer i.e. decreased crystallinity, more defects etc.","[10]","\nAt the PPC17 conference in Brisbane in Dec 2022, I met Prof. Christine Luscombe who gave a talk about semi-conducting polymers. In a question she received about a \u201cgreen\u201d alternative, she said exactly this about electrochemical deposition. Later, I spoke with her about my PhD project. She said that if someone could find a way to control the electrodeposition, that person would solve many of our problems in CP synthesis. I pondered upon this idea of being able to control electrodeposition. I thought it would be something really cool for a Post-Doc (First let\u2019s get through the PhD). But perhaps I have squandered on this idea in my research \u2013 solid-state depositions.
