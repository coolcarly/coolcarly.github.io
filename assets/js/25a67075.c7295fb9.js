I was close to a mental breakdown. I added some fresh sodium, and refluxed it for 1 hour and it still didn't dry!!!! But the thing is, the solvent doesn't need to be 100% dry for my reactions. I distilled out a bit of THF and set up a 0.1 g reaction scale (5 mL). Usually the material will turn pink but this time it remained white. I always thought the pink was a sign that the starting material l is reacting, but now I am realising that it may just be wet and the pink colour is a natural indicator? I guess we will see the outcome on Monday when I work up this reaction.
