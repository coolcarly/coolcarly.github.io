This was a great opportunity to read and write - which I did with the review article that we published, in early 2021.

I never thought the data I had was good enough, so I kept doing the same experiments hoping to get better data. Maybe this is what everyone experiences, because even Einstein said "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results".

It wasn't until I was writing Chapter 3 of my thesis, that my supervisors made me realise that the \"failed work\" was actually meaningful. It was a way to justify the change in my starting materials. Thus, Chapter 3 was one of the hardest chapters to write up, not only because it was boring to write about failures, but because I had to scramble through all the computers in the lab to salvage my data.
