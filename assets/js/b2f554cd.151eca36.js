The atmosphere was pretty dark with low lights - giving an almost romantic vibe.It was also rather large, with two areas seperated by a narrow wall - seperating the dining from the bar. \\n\\nFrom the minute we sat down, the waiters paid a lot of attention to us and our \\"needs\\". I say it like this, because it is not really a need, but more a want but I\'m sure that you get the gist of what I am saying. \\n\\nThis dining experience consisted of a tasting menu with a wine pairing. Yes, you heard (read) it right, a tasting menu. We were served 11 (each) small bites of food which resulted in us leaving with full bellies (not too full, but just right). I\'ve put the menu here: \\n\\n|![](yellow.png)|\\n|:---:|\\n|*Image caption:* The menu at Yellow: Food (left) and wine pairing (right).

This sourdough bread was very impressive. It was so fluffy and aerated, but the crust was also really crusty - easy to eat but not too hard. For sure the best sourdough bread I\'ve ever had. \\n\\nThis was a pretty cool experience. But yes, it was expensive. Dining alone was $110 pp (not including the mushroom tacos circled in the menu above - an extra $9 pp for a bite size, think of a Captain\'s Table cracker). The wine pairing was also an additional $145 pp. I wont be going back anytime soon because of this reason.

Manjits is an Indian restaurant. It is very popular and almost everyone in the Illawarra knows of it. We often order from Manjits using Uber Eats. We have only dined here once before, in September last year. \\n\\nAs Majits is a BYO restaurant, we took one of our New Zealand Syrah\'s with us that we got from Te Mata Estate in Hawke\'s Bay. They charge a $5 corking fee which is silly to be honest, as we pour the wine ourselves. But it works out to be a lot cheaper than ordering wines/beers at the restaurant. I also think it\'s a better option for us because our wines are probably much nicer than any of the one\'s they serve at the restaurant. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, the restaurant was very empty. We sat on the balcony, and there was probably 5 other tables occupied. However, considering that this restaurant is very large, it felt very empty.\\n\\nNick opened the wine to allow it to oxidise a little before we drank. The first sip was amazing! I was feeling a bit of regret that we opened this bottle tonight. My eyes watered at the amazing taste of the wine. It was so flavoursome with a full body. Even with the crazy spices of the Indian, it never overpowered the wine. *Side note: looking online, these bottles are $30 NZD. However, they do not ship to Australia \u2639\ufe0f*\\n\\nAs we sipped our wine and read through the menu, we were trying to remember the things that we ordered last time we were here (because they don\'t offer everything through Uber Eats). As I looked through my photos, I found a picture of the Samosa Chat that we ordered last year. I remember it being so delicious! Therefore, we ordered it again for an entre. On the menu, it says that the Samosa Chat comes in 2 pieces. We were tempted to get 2 but we stuck with only 1. This was a good decision as the serving was quite large. If we ordered more than one entre, it would have filled our bellies so much! \\n\\nFor the mains, we ordered Malai Kofta and Palak Paneer, with a side of rice and naans - Garlic for me and Chilli for Nick. The palak paneer was a must. This is the meal that I always order and the meal that I love! We were a little unsure of the Malai Kofta but once we tried it, we were in awe of the flavours and textures. It was served in a butter-like sauce, similar to their butter chicken. This was too much food though and I could not finish my naan or the Palak Paneer. Nontheless, our bellies were very satisfied! \\n\\n|![](./img/manjits.jpeg)|\\n|:---:|\\n|*Img caption: Our meals for the evening at Manjits*|"},{"id":"/2024/June/sourdough-pastry","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/June/sourdough-pastry","source":"@site/blog/2024/June/sourdough-pastry.md","title":"Sourdough pastry","description":"What can we do with sourdough discard?

I would hate to waste my sourdough discards, which is why I have been searching for different things to do with it. Did you know that discard lasts for a few days in the fridge?

Beforehand, I did a quick search and found that pastry follows the same method as a regular pastry recipe, only that it uses less flour. I used my previously developed Pastry recipe as follows: \\n\\nMakes 2 sheets of pastry\\n\\n**Ingredients:** <br/>\\n225 g flour <br/>\\n25 g butter<br/>\\n1 tbsp olive oil<br/>\\n1/2 tsp salt<br/>\\n1/2 tsp garlic powder<br/>\\n50-100 g of sourdough starter*<br/>\\n\\n**Method (pastry):** \\n1. The butter was cut into small cubes (0.5 cmx0.5cm) \\n2. The butter and flour was rubbed together to make a crumbled flour\\n3. The oil was added and mixed in, then the flour was rubbed further\\n4. salts were mixed in\\n5. Starter was mixed in. \\n6. A small amount of water was added (just to make it come together)\\n7. Stretch and fold of the pastry several times\\n8. Moulded the pastry into a Dish, covered and placed in the fridge overnight.*\\n\\n**Filling:**\\n1/2 brown onion <br/> \\n1 garlic cloves<br/>\\n1/4 cup cream<br/>\\n60 g ricotta<br/>\\n1/3 cup tasty cheese<br/>\\n200 g button mushrooms, sliced<br/>\\n2 handfulls of spinach<br/>\\n1 tsp salt\\n1/2 tsp pepper\\n\\n9. Over medium heat, melt butter and fry onion and garlic until onion is translucent. \\n10. Add mushrooms and fry until they start to sweat. \\n11. Add spinach.\\n12. In a seperate bowl, combine the cheese and cream. Add the mushroom mixture and salt and pepper. \\n13. Pour mixture into the dish (pre-moulded with pastry)\\n14. Cover the top with the second layer of pastry. \\n15. Bake at 200 \xb0C (fan forced) for 30 minutes. \\n\\n|![](./img/pastry-sourdough.jpeg)||\\n|:---:|\\n|*Img caption: The rolling out of one pastry (left), the filling of the pastry in the dish (middle) and the final product (right).*|\\n\\n**Notes about this recipe:**\\nNote about the starter: This was a discard that I kept in the fridge for 2 days. I think it is safe to leave sourdough discard for 3 days in the fridge, so I wanted to use it before I needed to throw it away. \\n\\nNOTE about the hydration: on the 26.06.24: before I added the starter, I added 1/2 cup of water (which I realised was a mistake therefore this recipe is tweaked). After I added the starter, it was very sticky! This was wrong, the consistency should be crumbly. Therefore, it is crucial to add the sourdough starter before extra water, so you correct the consistency. \\n\\nNote for step 8: Refrigeration is important for pastry. The colder it is, the better. You want the butter and oil to solidify to bring the crumbly consistency to your pastry. I also think that it will aid in bring flavours out of the sourdough."},{"id":"/2024/June/sourdough-pancakes","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/June/sourdough-pancakes","source":"@site/blog/2024/June/sourdough-pancakes.md","title":"Sourdough Pancakes","description":"On 23.6.24, I used my sourdough discard for the first time.

Recently I started working as a laboratory technician for ANFF ([Australian National Fabrication Facility](https://anff.org.au)), back at the Innovation Campus in Wollongong. ANFF is a government funded organisation that is designed to support Research and Development. There are several nodes located around Australia, with several in each state. The ANFF Materials node is located here at the University of Wollongong as well as the University of Newcastle, specialising in polymers, bioinks, and electromaterials.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been here for 2 weeks so far. At the moment, the work is pretty slow, yet I am trying to keep busy. I have been trained on the [ICP](./icp_.md) and elemental analyser and am waiting for traiing by Greg on the digestor in order to further my training on the ICP. I hope to use it a few times in order to become more familiar since I am now the official trainer for it. While I wait for things to happen here, I have continued my learning with python. In fact, today I wrote a program with the following purposes: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. To create a new folder with the month, then a folder with the date\\r\\n2. To take a file and convert it from txt to csv\\r\\n3. To extract the X and Y values from the folder and normalise the Y column. \\r\\n4. To create a line graph of the X and normalised Y values. \\r\\n5. To export the image as a png with the date and activity as the file name. \\r\\n\\r\\nI feel as excited about programing as I did with the synthesis of my polymers. Both of these skills have different thresholds and I think they can complement each other very nicely. I just wish I could get a mixture of lab work and desk work... As I was told today \\"This place is very slow, as there are many changes happening..\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, I have been learning a bi\xact of LaTeX. It was a large hurdle and a little traumatic installing it, only for Nick to point out to me later on that Typst (which I am more fluent with) is open access for offline use (something I did not realise before). Therefore, I looked through the extensions of VSCode and found the typst extension, which I immediately installed. I began to create a template for my publications, which is much nicer than using microsoft word!!!! If I could do one thing over again, it would be to use typst for my thesis. I will definitely be using this to create reports in the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn other news, both of the examiners have returned my PhD thesis. I am yet to receive it, however, my supervisors have told me that there are mostly minor corrections (They didn\'t want to give me too much information, and later I learned that they are not allowed to tell me anything). I\'m hoping that I can correct it soon, but I am very nervous about what it will say! \\r\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\r\\n\\r\\n|![phd revision](./img/phd-revision.PNG)|\\r\\n|:---:|\\r\\n|*Caption: The only information I can get about my thesis at this point*| \\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n*Date: 13.06.24* <br/>\\r\\nOn Friday, 7 June 2024 at 8:57 AM, I received an email from the Graduate Research School with my thesis examination. My PhD will be awarded, pending minor changes to the thesis. This is probably the best result that I could hope for.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I read the examiners reports, I was at first shocked and overwhelmed by the reports, however, as I read on, I realised that it was very positive, with only grammatical errors and mistakes. I ended up fixing my thesis within a day. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my reviewers said \\"The number of experiments performed was really impressive, even if part of them were unsuccessful and did not lead to the desired product.\\" The other said \\"In summary, this is an excellent thesis and I recommend that the candidate be awarded a PhD degree.\\" This made me feel really good about it. While I didn\'t get a commended thesis, I am glad that the reviews were positive. \\r\\n\\r\\n*Date: 17.06.24* <br/>\\r\\nOn Thursday 13 June 2024, I met with my PhD supervisors and discussed my thesis. They were happy with the changes that I made and gave me a few additional suggestions. The next day, I sent an email to the head of postgraduate studies asking if he was happy with my corrections. After consulting with my supervisors, he then sent an email to the graduate research school approving my final submission. At 10:15 am today, I submitted the final version of my thesis!!! I am proud of the work I did and while I haven\'t published any manuscripts (yet hopefully), I believe I added something novel to the literature."},{"id":"/2024/May/icp_","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/May/icp_","source":"@site/blog/2024/May/icp_.md","title":"Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry (MS)/Optical emission spectroscopy (OES)","description":"Recently I started a position as a lab technician with Australian National Fabrication Facility (ANFF).

The ICP in my lab at the University of Wollongong, with the labelled components*|\\r\\n\\r\\n## What is ICP?\\r\\nInductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry (MS) or optical emission spectroscopy (OES) is a method of elemental analysis which utilises a plasma source. In ICP-MS, the ions are directly measured. In contract, ICP-OES uses an optical spectrometer to measure the photons emitted as they pass through the plasma. While both methods are extremely fast to use, cheap and straightforward, the ICP-OES has a higher sensitivity to detection. \\r\\n\\r\\n## How does ICP work?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Schematic of ICP](./img/fig1-icp.jpeg)|\\r\\n|:---:|\\r\\n|*Figure 2. Schematic of ICP: (a) engineered setup and (b) behaviour of the sample inside the sample channel. Images taken from (Hou and Jones) and (McCurdy and Potter)* |\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA schematic of an ICP is displayed in Fig 2. The liquid sample is injected into a spray chamber which is converted to an aerosol via a nebuliser. During this process, only the very fine particles are injected into the inductor. In the inductor, the sample aerosol is further dried and vapourised due to the high temperatures (10000 K) in the sample carrier. In this process, all chemical bonds are broken, allowing for the vapourisation of each individual atom (Fig 2b). The free atoms collide with plasma, allowing them to transition to an excited state. Upon relaxation to ground state, the ions/atoms will emit a photon of characteristic energies, which can be used to determine the elemental origin of the ions. The total number of photons emitted is proportional to the concentration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ionisation plasma is typically argon gas as it is chemically inert and contains a high proportion of cations and electrons with a high electron density. In the set up shown in Fig 2a, radiofrequency (RF) is applied to a coil which produces \u201cseed\u201d electrons which are accelerated and collide with argon gas to form argon plasma and electrons:\\r\\n<p align=\\"center\\"> Ar(g) \u2192 Ar<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n## About sample preparation\\r\\nSolubilised solutions (aqueous or organic) are required to perform ICP analysis. Therefore, samples (<0.2 %>) are typically treated with nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) or HCl, in a process referred to as \\"acid digestion\\".  Sample concentrations of <0.2% are crucial to avoid any matrix effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Matrix effects\\r\\nMatrix effects are interferences in the analysis due ton signal dift caused by the deposition of solids on the sample apertures or signal suppression caused by salt ions. The typical salt interference is caused by oxide formation, which seems to reduce the ion flow and promotes clogging at the sample cone (the interface that analyses ion extraction). With years of research, matrix effects have typically solved through the use of OES compared to MS. ICP-OES relies on photon emission rather than ion acceleration, which makes it less susceptible to interferences. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Advantages of ICP compared to other elemental analyses\\r\\nAs ICP heats to very high temperatures, samples undergo more efficient vaporisation, atomisation and excitation. This allows for a wider range of elements to be analysed by ICP. In addition, the high temperature means that there is less water vapour present, in turn reducing the concentration of oxygen species and thus a lower level of matrix interferences caused by oxide formation. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## References\\r\\n1.\\tAmmann, A.A., Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS): a versatile tool.

At this rate, I won\'t finish my PhD in time!\\n\\n*A tip to improve productivity:* I was lucky this week in my Thursday meeting. I got a few tips from my supervisors about writing. David commented that the best thing to do when you are not feeling like thinking is to write out the methods chapter. He was right. Writing out my methods chapter is a simple way to get myself in the mood of writing and to continue my writing routine. \\n\\n*More unproductivity:* This morning, I went driving around Wollongong to try and get a quote to fix my passenger-side mirror of my car. Grant from Fernhill Smash Repairs told me that he would be in touch later in the afternoon. NOTE: the passenger side-mirror is no longer afixed to the car as I nipped it off on the way home from the beach yesterday. Without a passenger side-mirror, I cannot drive my car. This means that I can\'t drive to North Wollongong beach! I need to paddle in the morning for me to feel fresh for a day of writing! This screwed up my whole day. At 10 am, I gave up on writing and decided to head to Innovation Campus to get some data off the computers. I ran there and remained until 4 pm..... and that is all I did today.\\n\\nIn the evening, Nick and I walked to [The Barrel Shephard](/life/food-and-drink/craft-beer/illawarra/barrel-shephard) for dinner and drinks.

I was more than ready to make huge progress today! \\n\\nI arrived at work at 9 am and from the minute I began to do things in the lab, everything went wrong. I couldn\'t get any good data. Around 10 am, I went to get help to fix a cable for my potentiostat (as the wires lost connection to reduce the signal). However, I was unsuccessful in getting help. A colleague/researcher said to meet her at 3 pm to repair the cable; but I couldnt wait this long as I was due to teach at 1.30 til 4.30 pm (Week 3 of Semester 2).. \\n\\nBy this point it was 11 am - I was feeling really tired and unmotivated. \\n\\nMy first thought was to go home. I lost motivation when I realised that I would only be home for 1 hour before having to leave again. Instead, I pulled out my soft back warmer from my draw and used it as a pillow. I put my head down on the desk and had an hour nap. \\n\\nI woke up less tired than before, but really groggy. I packed my safety glasses and water bottle into my handbag and walked towards my car, then drove to the main campus. Travel between the innovation campus and the main campus is really tedious and it is often difficult to find parking in the middle of the day. \\n\\nI was parked and ready to get out of the car at 1 pm. I walked towards Panzinis, a cafe located in front of the UOW library. I go here for coffee because they offer staff discounts and I love discouts! I ordered my coffee and it was made within 5 minutes. It was a rather pleasant experience - too bad that I was not in a good mood. \\n\\nThe undergraduate chemistry labs are located in building 21 on level 3. I headed here after I was handed my coffee - but I was at least 20 minutes early. When I walked into the lab, it was empty abar one demonstrator - Sue. I chatted for less than a minute before rereading over my emails that said I was only rostered for Week 9. In sheer disbelief, I spent a few minutes researching my emails and was convinced that I showed up for no reason! In embarrassment, I left and drove to North Wollongong beach. \\"Wow\\" I thought. \\"How stupid\\". \\"Why didn\'t I read my emails?\\" \\n\\nI was pretty relieved though, because I didn\'t really want to teach. I don\'t need the extra funds that bad and it\'s not worth taking time away from my writing. Excited that I could fix the potentiostat, I also sent an email to a colleague, indicating my error and that I would be there at 3 pm. \\n\\nJust as I was about to get out of my car and go for a dip in the ocean to calm down my anxiety and embarrassment, I received an email from Giel (the subject coordinator) who asked me to come back because I was rostered to work. Can you believe how embarrassed I was after this? It took me 15 minutes to return, park and walk to the labs. I quickly walked into the service room, dodging the lines of students waiting to collect a pH probe for their experiment. I threw on a red lab coat, my safety glasses and grabbed a pen. \\n\\nI apologised several times to Giel and I literally felt like slapping my forehead because it was such a stupid thing that happened. The worst thing though, was sending a third email to my colleague telling her that I was wrong and I was meant to teach! \\n\\nThe labs were very slow and very basic. The students were working on acid-base titrations. In that moment, I thought that it wasn\'t too bad. I actually enjoyed it.  I\'m just glad that I don\'t have to teach all the time. The labs ended at 4.30 pm. I drove straight home and relaxed until dinner time. \\n\\nI honestly feel like I wasted the whole day."},{"id":"/2023/08/04/2023-08/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/08/04/2023-08/","source":"@site/blog/2023-08/2023-08-04.md","title":"Rewarding myself","description":"Lately, I have been freaking out with the amount of work still left in my PhD.

Wow, where has the time gone? Five months left until I need to submit my PhD thesis. \\n\\nI arrived home from work after an unsuccessful day in the lab. The electrodes attached to my potentiostat were disfunctioning. I spent my 3 hours of lab time, trying to trouble shoot the problem. With the help of one of the guys in the workshop, I was able to fix the electrode. However, upon a \\"dummy test\\", the signal was not strong. I gave up, and decided to go home and not waste anymore time. \\n\\nI arrived home and prepared a quiche for dinner. I was feeling inspired by Emma (as over the weekend, she made a really awesome scrambled eggs). The egg filling alone contained some butter and rosemary. \\n\\nAfter I finished preparing dinner, I was still in the mood to cook - anything to avoid working on my thesis! I decided to prepare tomorrow nights dinner as well. \\n\\nI don\'t know about you, but I get tired of eating similar things all the time. I feel like it is super boring and not creative at all. While I was having these thoughts, I had finished the rest of our loaf of bread. That\'s when I was inspired to make some bread. \\n\\nI remember when I was much younger, around 15 years old and would often bake various things for my family. I enjoyed baking a lot - from bread to cakes. However, I saw so many people around me who were a lot better. I often compared myself to others and it really demotivated me to cook (Yes, I always wanted to be the best). I wonder what life would have been like if I didn\'t compare myself and just did the things that I enjoyed - because I enjoyed them. \\n\\nMaybe my enjoyment of baking and \\"creative cooking\\" is the reason that I chose chemistry. I always wonder what drove me to stay in chemistry. I usually say that it was because I got the best marks for the least amount of effort - which is probably true. Now, I am thinking that it was also because I was using my hands to create something. Synthesis is very similar to cooking: a step by step process to create something wonderful. \\n\\nThe funny thing is though, I struggle so much to follow recipes. The same thing applies in the lab: I struggle a lot to follow new synthetic protocols. This caused so much stress during my undergrad: as I didn\'t perform as well as some of the other students. Somehow I have made it through and am almost finished a PhD in chemistry! Sometimes I forget how amazing it is that I\'ve made it this far.

We spoke about the structure and story of the research paper, and their feedback was very helpful. I\'m kicking myself that I didn\'t show them sooner and push for this to be published 2 years ago (when the work was originally done).\\n\\nDuring this meeting, I didn\'t realise that I was figgeting a lot. I was playing with my hair, biting my nails, moving around and just sitting very casually. Afterwards, it was pointed it out, and I was really embarrassed. I am glad that he said something to me though, because I feel like in future meetings I can pay closer attention to it. \\n\\nIn my defense though, my PhD feels very casual. I feel like my supervisors are my family; but maybe I am taking my comfort for granted. I also feel like it is not my work place. I am not treated like a staff member, nor do I get the same treatment as a staff member. \\n\\nI went home after the meeting feeling really embarrased and a bit upset. To be honest, at the moment, I don\'t like certain things about myself; like my current connection with friends or my behaviour when I am stressed or anxious. I feel like I\'ve spent a lot of time complaining about things and blaming others for my bad attitude. I need to retake control of my actions, stop complaining and just get stuff done. \\n\\nI worked through comments for the rest of the day and then around 4 pm, I decided to go out for a run. Running has always helped me cope with my anxiety. I ran 10 km - which is the most I\'ve ran since the marathon back in July 2022. My mood significantly improved since the run; however, not long after, I started to feel a bit sad. I want things to change.
