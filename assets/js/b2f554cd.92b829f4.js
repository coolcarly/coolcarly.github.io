The whole first half of the game, the ball was down the opposite end of the field (as Raiders had majority possession). I was excited for the second half, thinking that Raiders would be mostly down our end. HOwever, during the second half, Dragons had majority possession and scored at least 4 tries to make it almost even. \\n\\nA few other families from Rainbow Club attended the match too. I got to catch up with them, which was really nice. I do miss the people at Rainbow Club. It\'s just a shame that I do not enjoy teaching anymore.
