Both types of haploids secrete pheromones to attract one another. The MAT\u03b1 secretes a soluble \u03b1-factor, while MATa seretes a fatty acid modified peptide, which is excreted from the cell via an ABC transporter (a protein on the cell membrane that facilitates active transport). The high lipophillicity of the peptide, causes it to remain in the plasma membrane, while the soluble factor travels through the media. The yeast cells can polarise (change shape) according to the direction of the pheromones secreted. Once the two opposite haploids come together, they mate to form a diploid zygote. Meosis (a process of sex cell replication) creates 4x replicates of the DNA to form four haploid cells, contained within the ascosphere walls.

Starvation induces meiosis and sporulation in an attempt to preseve the genetic diversity but, the cells remain in a non-dividing state.
