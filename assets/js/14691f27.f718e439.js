These functional groups consist of mostly carbon and hydrogen groups which do not interact well with water. Therefore, most organic compounds do not dissolve in water. Instead of exhibiting hydrogen bonds or ionic groups that can interact with water, they exhibit Van der Waals interactions. These interactions are weak non-ionic interactions that occur between carbon and hydrogen functionality. Thus, these molecules can only be dissolved by solvents that also exhibit Van de Waals interactions: such as petroleum or hydrocarbon based solvents.
