This is owing to our patrol captains; Pat and Damo who always push the rest of us to do things. For example, Pat handed me a radio, told me to head to Puckeys to check out the surf, and perform a radio check. In my previous patrol, the Captain or Vice captain would just do it themselves, so I was never confident in speaking over the radio or in performing hand signals.

The rescue went very well. Afterwards, I received very positive feedback from my patrol captain. He made me realise that the area that I need to work on is my communication.
